narrator "After a short drive, we spotted a small clearing just off the road, sheltered by thick underbrush and the towering trees."

narrator "Calyx parked the car and we stepped out, the cool night air wrapping around us like a blanket."

narrator "The sounds of the forest filled the space, a gentle reminder that we were not alone, even in our solitude."

narrator "We settled on the ground, leaning against the car as we unpacked our meager meal. The supplies we had taken from the store were sparse, but they would sustain us for the moment."

narrator "Each crunch echoed in the silence, reminding me of how different life had been just hours before."

Ysella "Do you think we should start a fire?"

narrator "I asked, glancing around at the darkness enveloping us."

narrator "Calyx nodded." 

Calyx "It’ll keep us warm and help us stay alert. Plus, it’ll give us a bit of light."

narrator "He and Dad gathered some twigs and leaves, and after a few attempts, a small flame flickered to life."

narrator "The warmth spread through me, and I watched as the light danced, casting shadows that seemed to play tricks on my mind."

narrator "As we settled around the fire, I reached down to pat Coal, the dog who had joined us on this chaotic journey."

narrator "His thick fur was comforting beneath my fingers, and I could feel the tension in his body gradually easing as he leaned into my touch."

Ysella "Hey, boy..." 

narrator "I whispered, my voice softening as I scratched behind his ears."

Ysella "You’re a brave one, aren’t you?"

narrator "Coal looked up at me with his wide, expressive eyes, as if he understood every word."

narrator "In that moment, he felt like a guardian, a silent protector in this unpredictable world." 

narrator "I glanced over at my dad, who was staring into the flames, lost in thought."

Ysella "Dad," 

narrator "I said, my voice breaking the quiet."

Ysella "Do you think Mom would have liked him?"

narrator "Calyx, sensing the weight of our conversation, nodded and quietly stepped back."

narrator "He turned and walked toward the path leading back to the car, leaving the two of us surrounded by the towering trees and the soft rustle of leaves."

narrator "He looked up, a hint of surprise flickering across his face."

Lyon "Your mom loved animals." 

narrator "He replied, a small smile creeping onto his lips."

Lyon "I remember when we got our first dog together. She was so excited, she could hardly contain herself. I think she would have adored Coal."

narrator "I smiled at the thought, imagining my mom laughing as she played with a dog like Coal."

Ysella "I wish I could remember her better..." 

narrator "I admitted, my fingers still gently stroking Coal’s fur. "Sometimes it feels like I’m losing pieces of her."

narrator "Dad shifted his gaze back to the fire, the flames reflecting in his eyes." 

Lyon "You’re not losing her, Ysella. She’s a part of you, always. Every time you show bravery, every time you care for someone, that’s her in you."

narrator "I nodded, feeling a warmth spread through me that had nothing to do with the fire."

Ysella "I want to be brave, Dad. Just like you said. Just like Coal."

narrator "He chuckled softly, glancing at the dog." 

Lyon "Well, you’ve got a good role model right here. Look at him— he’s ready to protect us no matter what."

narrator "Coal lifted his head and let out a low, reassuring bark, as if he understood the weight of our conversation."

narrator "I couldn’t help but smile at him, feeling a sense of comfort in his presence."

Ysella "Yeah, he really is something special," 

narrator "I said, giving Coal another gentle pat."

Ysella "I think he’s going to help us get through this."

narrator "Dad nodded, his expression serious but proud."

Lyon "You’re right. We need to stick together, all of us. We’ll find a way to keep moving forward, and we’ll do it as a team."

narrator "The fire crackled, sending sparks into the night sky, and I felt a renewed sense of hope."

narrator "With Coal by our side and my dad’s unwavering support, I knew we could face whatever challenges lay ahead."

Ysella "Let’s make a promise," 

narrator I suggested, looking at my dad. 

Ysella "No matter what happens, we’ll always look out for each other. And for Coal."

narrator "He smiled, a glimmer of determination in his eyes."

Lyon "I promise, Ysella. We’ll always have each other’s backs."

narrator "As I continued to stroke Coal’s fur, I felt a bond forming between us—a connection that transcended the chaos surrounding us."

narrator "In that moment, I knew we were not just fighting for survival;"

narrator "we were fighting for family, for love, and for the memories of those we had lost."

narrator "For a moment, neither spoke again, the silence between us filled by the steady warmth of the bonfire."

narrator "Finally, Dad broke the quiet, his voice low and contemplative."

Lyon "Your mom and I… we met in a place not much different from this."

Lyon "Your mom... she was everything." 

narrator "He added, his voice soft and thick with memory." 

Lyon "We met by accident, but it felt like destiny—like we were meant to find each other in the chaos of life."

Lyon "She could light up any room with her smile, even when everything was falling apart."

narrator "I looked up, surprised. It wasn’t often that he mentioned my mom,"

narrator "I knew because he never did when I was in their house, especially not in the middle of a chaotic night like this."

narrator "He stared into the flames, his eyes reflecting memories she couldn’t see."

Lyon "It was… unexpected. We were young, wild, full of ideas of what life could be. I thought we could make it work, no matter what."

narrator "I listened intently, the warmth of the fire almost soothing, despite the turmoil that had become our lives." 

Lyon "I loved her deeply, but love doesn’t always mean forever."

Lyon "Sometimes... people are meant to cross paths for a while and then..."

Lyon "they have to take different roads." 

narrator "His eyes glistened as he stared into the flames."

Lyon "We tried. We really did."

narrator "He paused, smiling faintly."

Lyon "One night, she convinced me to sneak onto this rooftop."

Lyon "She said she wanted to watch the stars, but really, she just wanted to laugh at how bad I was at climbing." 

narrator "His chuckle was low and soft. 

Lyon "It was so ridiculous, but I was happy. Those moments... they mattered more than anything else."

narrator "My throat tightened at the thought of my mother whom I barely remembered. 

Ysella "What happened? Why didn’t it work?" 

narrator "I asked quietly."

narrator "Dad sighed, running a hand through his hair."

Lyon "Life just got in the way. I wasn’t ready for the responsibility. I thought I had time to figure it all out, but time slipped away."

Lyon "And in the end, your mom deserves someone who was fully there for her—something I couldn’t be." He looked at me then, his gaze full of regret."

Lyon "But I’ll never stop loving her. She gave me you."

narrator "He glanced at me, the firelight catching in his eyes."

Lyon "It wasn’t because we didn’t care. We just couldn’t…"

Lyon "find a way to make it last."

narrator "I felt a knot form in his chest."

narrator "For all the times I’d wondered why they weren’t together, I’d never really asked him."

narrator "But hearing him now, it wasn’t anger that I felt—it was a deep understanding."

narrator "He looked down at the fire, a wistful smile tugging at his lips as memories flickered in his eyes."

Lyon "I remember the way she laughed when I first taught her how to drive.

Lyon "We were out in the middle of nowhere, much like tonight."

Lyon "She stalled the car so many times, but she never gave up. She was determined, stubborn even."

Lyon "It’s one of the things I loved most about her."

narrator "He paused, the crackling of the fire filling the space between them."

Lyon "There was this one night, we sat on the hood of the car, under the stars, talking about everything and nothing."

Lyon "She told me that if we ever had a daughter, she hoped she’d be brave. Just like you."

narrator "He glanced at me, his voice softening." 

Lyon "She was always dreaming, always thinking about a future where everything worked out."

narrator "Dad stared into the fire, his voice growing softer."

Lyon "I just… I want you to know something, Ysella."

Lyon "I’ve learned to love your stepmother—she’s a good woman, and she’s been there for me."

Lyon "But there wasn’t a single day that I didn’t think about your mom."

Lyon "I still love her."

Lyon "I always will." 

Lyon "She was the kind of person who leaves a mark on your heart, no matter how much time passes."

narrator "He sighed, the weight of the years pressing down on him." 

Lyon "But sometimes, no matter how much you love someone, life pulls you in different directions."

Lyon "It doesn’t mean the love wasn’t real. It just means… it wasn’t meant to last."

narrator "I swallowed hard, my heart heavy yet strangely lightened by his words."

narrator "As my dad’s memories wove through the air, it felt as if a piece of my mom had come alive again, if only for a moment."

narrator "And in that moment, by the bonfire, while the world outside still teetered on the edge of chaos, I felt something deep inside me begin to heal."

narrator "As the fire burned low, the warmth slowly faded, silence settled between me and dad."

narrator "It wasn’t an uncomfortable silence—more like the quiet that comes after a storm, when everything feels a little clearer."

narrator "The night around us was still, save for the occasional rustle of leaves or the distant howl of some unseen creature.

narrator "I gazed up at the stars, the sky seeming so vast, so indifferent to everything happening below."

narrator "I felt small, but at the same time, anchored by my dad’s presence."

Ysella "You think she’d be proud of me?" 

narrator "I whispered, almost afraid to ask."

narrator "Dad didn’t answer right away."

narrator "Instead, he stirred the embers with a stick, watching the sparks fly up into the dark sky."

narrator "She’d be more than proud, Ysella. She’d be in awe."

narrator "I gave his dad a smile–one that conveys gratitude and affection."

narrator "We sat in silence for a moment longer before Calyx returned, his figure emerging from the shadows."

Calyx "Here’s some water and food." 

narrator "He said, his voice low but steady."

Calyx "We’ll need to keep moving soon."

narrator "Dad nodded."

Lyon "We should rest for a few more hours, then head out at dawn."

narrator "But the peace was short-lived."

narrator "A snap echoed from the woods, a sound too sharp, too deliberate."

narrator "Dad stiffened immediately, eyes narrowing as he scanned the treeline."

Lyon "Stay behind me!" 

Lyon "He ordered in a low, urgent voice, rising to his feet."

narrator "The snap turned into a rustling, followed by the unmistakable sound of hurried footsteps approaching from the shadows."

narrator "Calyx stood up quickly, already tense and alert. We exchanged a glance, and my heart began to race."

narrator "Before I could even react, figures burst out from the trees, shadowy and swift, their faces hidden in the dark."

narrator "There were too many to count."

Lyon "Run!" 

narrator "Dad shouted, pushing me back toward the car. His voice cut through the confusion like a sharp blade."

narrator "My legs felt rooted to the ground, terror freezing me in place as I watched the strangers close in."

narrator "Dad grabbed a thick branch from the ground, swinging it fiercely to keep them at bay."

narrator "One of them lunged forward, only to be met with a sharp blow that sent them stumbling back.

narrator "But they weren’t deterred."

Lyon "Go! Now!" 

narrator "He yelled again, his voice a mixture of desperation and command."

narrator "His eyes flicked to me, full of urgency and something that looked like finality."

narrator "Calyx grabbed my arm, pulling me toward the car, but the strangers were quick—too quick."

narrator "One blocked our path, and another darted around the car, cutting off any chance of escape."

narrator "Dad roared, charging forward with reckless abandon, swinging the branch wildly."

narrator "He knocked two of them down, his movements fueled by sheer will, but more kept coming."

narrator "Then, just as the situation seemed most dire, Coal sprang into action."

narrator "The large black dog, who had been resting near the car, leaped forward, barking fiercely as he positioned himself between dad and the approaching strangers."

narrator "His powerful frame and loud barks caught them off guard, buying a precious moment for dad."

Lyon "Coal! Get back!" 

narrator "Dad shouted, but the dog stood his ground, teeth bared, ready to protect."

narrator "I felt a surge of hope as Coal charged at one of the strangers, knocking him off balance and creating a brief opening."

Ysella "Dad! We can get away!" 

narrator "I cried, my heart racing with renewed determination."

narrator "But my father was still engaged in a fierce struggle, grappling with another attacker on the ground."

narrator "Coal continued to fight valiantly, darting between the strangers, barking and snapping, trying to keep them at bay."

Lyon "Go!" 

narrator "Dad yelled again, his voice hoarse."
"Calyx pulled me away, but I couldn’t tear her eyes away from the scene unfolding before me."
"Coal was doing everything he could, but the odds were against him."
"Then, it happened too fast."
"One of the strangers, faster and larger than the others, tackled my dad to the ground."
"They struggled, the branch knocked from his hands as they rolled in the dirt."
"Coal lunged at the attacker, teeth bared, but another stranger grabbed him by the collar, pulling him away just as dad landed a solid punch."

Ysella "Dad!" 

narrator "I screamed, my voice hoarse, breaking as I took a step toward him."
"Calyx pulled me back again forcefully this time, nearly dragging me as we scrambled into the forest.

Calyx "We can’t stay, Ysella! We have to go!"

narrator "I struggled against him, my body twisting, trying to break free, but it was too late."
"Dad’s figure was barely visible now." 
"The stranger holding him down, and then—he disappeared."
"The last thing I saw was my father being dragged into the dark forest, swallowed by the shadows."
"His final, desperate shout echoed in my ears, burning into her mind."
"Go!"
"In that moment, I felt a pang of helplessness, but Coal’s fierce barking cut through the chaos."
"The dog was fighting with everything he had, but the odds were stacked against him."

Ysella "Coal!" 

narrator "I cried, my heart breaking as I watched the scene unfold."
"Calyx’s grip tightened on my arm, pulling me through the trees, but I couldn’t tear my gaze away."
"I wanted to turn back, to fight for my dad and for Coal, but they had no choice."
"The darkness of the forest consumed us, leaving behind the distant crackling of the dying bonfire and the crushing silence of my father's absence."
"As we ran through the forest, the darkness seemed to swallow us whole. I stumbled over roots and fallen branches, my heart racing with every snap and creak of the trees."
"Calyx's grip on my arm was like a vice, pulling me forward as we desperately tried to escape."
"We didn't dare look back, fearing what we might see. The strangers' shouts and footsteps grew fainter, but I knew they could catch up to us at any moment."
"My legs burned, my lungs heaved, and my mind reeled with the image of my dad being dragged away, and now Coal, too, caught in the chaos."
"Eventually, Calyx slowed to a stop, his chest heaving as he listened intently."
"I strained my ears, but all I could hear was the distant howling of wolves and the creaking of trees in the wind."

Calyx "We need to keep moving." 

narrator "Calyx whispered, his eyes scanning the surroundings."

Calyx "We can't stay here."

narrator "The moon hung high in the sky, casting a silvery glow over the forest as I sat on a fallen log, my hands trembling in my lap."

narrator "The events of the day replayed in my mind like a relentless loop—shouts, chaos, the sound of metal clashing, and the moment I had lost control."

narrator "I could still hear the cries of those who had fought alongside me, the weight of their loss pressing down on my chest."

narrator "Calyx approached quietly, sensing the heaviness in the air."

Calyx "Ysella?" 

Calyx "Are you okay?"

narrator "I looked up, my eyes glistening with unshed tears."

Ysella "No," 

narrator "I whispered, my voice breaking."

Ysella "I can’t shake it off. I thought I was ready for this…"
"but I wasn’t. I couldn’t save them."

narrator "Calyx’s heart ached at the sight of my distress."

Calyx "You did everything you could..." 

narrator "He said gently, placing a reassuring hand on my back."

Calyx "You fought bravely."
"It wasn’t your fault."

narrator "But the words felt hollow to me."

Ysella "I should have been better. I should have seen it coming." 

narrator "A single tear slipped down my cheek, and I wiped it away angrily, as if trying to erase the pain."

Calyx "Hey," 
"It’s okay to feel this way. You’re human. You care, and that makes you stronger, not weaker."

narrator "I shook my head, frustration bubbling up inside me."

Ysella "I feel so helpless. I wanted to protect everyone, and instead, I just… I just watched."

narrator "Calyx turned to face me fully, his expression earnest."

Calyx "You’re not helpless, Ysella. You’ve faced so much and kept going."
"It’s okay to break down sometimes. It doesn’t mean you’re weak; it means you’re alive."

narrator "His words pierced through my turmoil, and I felt the floodgates open."

Ysella "I’m scared, Calyx,"  
"I’m scared of failing again. I don’t want to lose anyone else."

narrator "Calyx moved closer, wrapping an arm around my shoulders."

Calyx "You won’t lose me. I promise." 
"We’re in this together, and I’ll always be by your side."

narrator "I leaned into him, the warmth of his presence grounding me."

Ysella "What if I can’t do this?" 

narrator "I whispered, my vulnerability laid bare."

Calyx "You can," 
"You’ve shown so much strength already, and it’s okay to lean on others when you’re feeling weak." 
"We all have our moments of doubt, but that doesn’t define who we are."

narrator "As Calyx spoke, I felt the tension in my chest begin to ease, if only slightly. I took a shaky breath, trying to absorb his words."
 
Ysella "But what if I let you down?" 

Calyx "You won’t. We’re a team, and we learn from each other." 
"If you stumble, I’ll be right there to catch you. You’re not alone in this."

narrator "Tears streamed down my cheeks, and I let them fall freely now, the weight of my emotions crashing over me like a wave."

Ysella "I just feel so lost sometimes," 
"I want to be strong, to protect everyone, but I don’t know if I can do it."

Calyx "You don’t have to have all the answers," 
"Strength isn’t about never feeling fear or doubt; it’s about facing those feelings and pushing through them." 
"You’re stronger than you realize, Ysella. You’ve fought through so much already."

narrator "I leaned my head against him, finding solace in his presence." 

Ysella "I don’t want to be a burden," 

narrator "You could never be a burden," 
"You bring so much to me. It’s okay to let yourself feel, to be vulnerable." 
"That’s how we grow."

narrator "As the night wore on, the stars twinkling above them, I felt a flicker of hope igniting within me."
"Calyx’s unwavering support wrapped around me like a warm blanket, easing the ache in my heart." 

Ysella "Thank you for being here."

Calyx "Always..." 
"You’re not just a warrior; you’re a friend, more than that, actually."
 "And friends support each other through thick and thin."

narrator "With a deep breath, I closed my eyes, allowing the moment to wash over me." 
"The weight of my fears didn’t vanish entirely, but it felt lighter now, shared with someone who truly understood."
"I nodded and stood up, still trying to process what had just happened." 
"My dad, the man I barely knew but had just begun to connect with, was gone." 
"The thought sent a wave of grief crashing over me, and I felt my knees buckle."
"Calyx caught me, holding me upright as I sobbed uncontrollably. 

Calyx "I'm sorry, Ysella," 
"I'm so sorry."

narrator "I didn’t know how long we stood there, but eventually, Calyx gently pulled me forward, urging me to keep moving."
"We walked in silence, the only sound being the rustling of leaves and the distant howling of wolves."
"As we walked, memories of my dad flooded my mind, though they were few and far between."
"I recalled the rare moments we had shared—his warm smile when he first saw me, the way he awkwardly tried to connect with me, the stories he told about my mom." 
"I felt a deep ache in my chest, a longing for the father-daughter bond I had always wished for but never fully experienced."
"The pain of losing him was like a weight crushing me, making it hard to breathe." 
"I felt guilty for not having more memories, for not being able to protect him, for not being able to save him." 
"I felt angry at the strangers who had taken him away, at the world for being so cruel."
"Calyx' hand found mine, his fingers intertwined with mine as we walked." 
"It was a small comfort, but it was something. I squeezed his hand, trying to convey my gratitude without words."
"We walked for what felt like hours, the darkness slowly giving way to a faint light on the horizon."
"As the sun began to rise, casting a golden glow over the forest, I felt a sense of determination rising within me."
"I would survive this. I would find a way to make it through this apocalypse, no matter what it took." 
"And I would make sure that my dad's sacrifice wasn't in vain, even if our time together had been so short."
"I looked up at Calyx, his eyes meeting mine with a glimmer of understanding. We didn't need to say a word; we both knew what we had to do." 
"We would keep moving, keep fighting, until we found a way to reclaim our world."
"Together, we walked towards the rising sun, our footsteps quiet on the forest floor." 
"The journey ahead would be long and hard, but with Calyx by my side, I felt a sense of hope that I hadn't felt in a long time."
"As we walked, the silence between us was comfortable, a testament to the bond we'd formed in the midst of chaos." 
"The forest seemed to stretch on forever, the trees growing taller and the underbrush thicker with every step." 
"I was starting to lose hope, wondering if we'd ever find a place to call safe, when Calyx suddenly stopped."

Calyx "Look!" 

narrator "I followed his gaze, and my heart skipped a beat as I saw it—a small, secluded cabin nestled among the trees." 
"Smoke drifted lazily from the chimney, and a faint light flickered in the window."
"Calyx' grip on my hand tightened as we approached the cabin, our senses on high alert for any signs of danger." 
"But as we drew closer, I sensed a strange feeling—peace. It was as if the cabin was a haven, a sanctuary from the madness that had consumed the world."
"We exchanged a look, and without a word, we crept towards the cabin, our footsteps quiet on the forest floor." 
"Calyx pushed open the creaky door, and we stepped inside, our eyes adjusting to the warm, golden light."
"The cabin was small, but it was cozy, with a fire crackling in the hearth and a kettle simmering on the stove." 
"A small table in the center of the room was set with two chairs, and a single candle cast a warm glow over the space."
"Calyx let out a slow breath, his shoulders relaxing as he took in the surroundings." 

Calyx "This is it." 
"This is where we can rest, where we can be safe."

narrator "I nodded, feeling a sense of relief wash over me. We'd found a haven, a place to call our own, if only for a little while."
"As we sat down at the table, Calyx' eyes met mine, and for a moment, we just looked at each other, the silence between us speaking volumes."
"Then, without warning, Calyx spoke up, his voice low and gentle." 

Calyx "Ysella, I know how you're feeling right now. Lost, scared, and angry all at once."

narrator "I nodded, feeling a lump form in my throat. 

Ysella "How did you know?"

narrator "Calyx' eyes dropped, his gaze fixed on the table as he began to speak." 

Calyx "I've been there too, Ysella. I've lost people I loved, people who were taken from me too soon."
"I sensed a deep sadness in his voice, a pain that he'd carried with him for a long time."

Calyx "My parents, they died when I was young, and my grandparents took me in." 
"I was too young to understand what was happening, but I knew I had to leave the neighborhood." 
"I couldn't stay in a place that held so many memories of them."

narrator "I felt a pang of empathy, a sense of connection to Calyx that I hadn't felt before." 
"As I looked into his eyes, I saw a glimmer of something more, something that went beyond mere friendship." 
"It was a spark that I thought had long been extinguished, a spark of affection that I had felt for Calyx before he left the neighborhood."
 "As I gazed at him, I realized that the spark had never truly gone away. It had been smoldering beneath the surface, waiting to be fanned back into flame." 
"And now, as I looked at Calyx, I felt it ignite once more."

Calyx "I never got to say goodbye to you, Ysella," 
"I'm sorry I left without a word. But I'm glad we're together now, Ysella." 
"We can face this together, as long as we have each other."

narrator "As he spoke, his eyes locked onto mine, and I felt a flutter in my chest." 
"It was a feeling I couldn't quite explain, a sense of attraction that I hadn't expected." 
"But it was also a feeling that I had known before, a feeling that I had thought was lost forever."

Ysella "I'm glad we're together too, Calyx," 

narrator "Calyx' eyes crinkled at the corners as he smiled, and I felt my heart skip a beat." 
"It was a small moment, but it was enough to make me realize that my feelings for Calyx went far beyond mere friendship."
"As we sat there, the silence between us was no longer uncomfortable."
"Instead, it was filled with a sense of possibility, a sense that we might just find something more in this desolate world."
"Just then, we heard a faint noise behind us. We turned to see an old lady standing in the doorway, her expression a mix of surprise and suspicion."

Agnes "What are you doing in my cabin?"
"Have you been bitten?"

narrator "I felt a wave of panic wash over me. 

Ysella "No, we haven't! We were just looking for a safe place to rest."

narrator "The old lady narrowed her eyes, taking a cautious step forward." 

Agnes "You can't be too careful these days. I’ve seen too many people turn after being bitten." 
"I won’t let you bring danger into my home."

narrator "Calyx raised his hands in a gesture of peace." 

Calyx "We understand your concern. We just need a place to rest for a day." 
"We can help you defend this cabin if anything happens."

narrator "Agnes studied us for a moment, her gaze piercing. Finally, she sighed, her expression softening just a fraction."

Agnes "Fine. You can stay for one night. But if I see anything suspicious, you’re out."

narrator "Relieved, we settled in, grateful for the warmth of the cabin and the chance to catch our breath." 
"As the evening wore on, Calyx and I shared stories, and I felt a growing bond between us." 
"Agnes, though skeptical, occasionally joined our conversation, her demeanor gradually softening as she listened to our tales of survival."
 "However, the peace was short-lived. In the early hours of the morning, a distant growl echoed through the woods, followed by a chorus of moans." 
"My heart raced as I realized what it was—a horde of zombies was approaching."
"Agnes’ eyes widened with fear. 

Agnes "We need to barricade the door!"

narrator "Calyx and I rushed to help, but it was too late." 
"The horde had already surrounded the cabin, their relentless pounding on the door threatening to break it down."
"Agnes’ face is set in a determined expression." 

Agnes "I'll hold them off. You two need to get out of here, find a way to escape."

narrator "Calyx and I exchanged a horrified glance." 

Ysella "No, Agnes, we can't leave you!" 

narrator "Agnes’ eyes locked on mine, a deep sadness in their depths." 

Agnes "I'm old, Ysella. I've lived my life. I've seen the world." 
"You two have a chance to make a difference." 
"Don't waste it."

narrator "With a heavy heart, Calyx and I reluctantly agreed." 
"As we made our way to the back door, Agnes stood tall, a fierce determination in her eyes."

Ysella "I'll hold them off as long as I can," 
"Get out of here, and don't look back."

narrator "With a final glance at Agnes, we fled into the darkness, the sounds of the zombie horde and Agnes’ defiant cries echoing behind us."
"As we trekked through the dense forest, the air was thick with tension and the scent of damp earth." 
"We had been traveling for days, our only company was the rustling leaves and the distant echoes of the undead." 
"Each step felt heavier than the last, but we pressed on, motivated by the hope of reaching the evacuation site."

narrator "One afternoon, we stumbled upon an abandoned cabin. Cautiously, we entered, scanning for any useful supplies. The silence was palpable as we searched, every creak of the floorboards making them jump. My heart raced as I rummaged through the cabinets, my hand brushing against Calyx' as we reached for the same can of food."

narrator "Our eyes met, and for a moment, the weight of our situation faded. We shared a quiet smile, a flicker of warmth amidst the chaos. "Sorry about that," I said, my voice barely above a whisper. Calyx chuckled, his eyes crinkling at the corners. "It's okay. I think we're both a little on edge."
narrator "Later that night, we set up camp in a small clearing. The darkness enveloped us, and the sounds of the forest felt menacing. My heart raced as shadows danced around us, my imagination running wild with worst-case scenarios. Calyx noticed my unease and moved closer, wrapping an arm around my shoulders. "Hey, it's just the wind," he whispered, his voice steady. "I'm here."
 "I leaned into him, feeling a sense of safety I hadn't felt in a long time. I closed my eyes, letting the warmth of his body seep into mine." 

Ysella "Thanks, Calyx," 
"I don't know what I'd do without you."

narrator "As we sat by the fire, we began to share their stories—fears, dreams, and memories of happier times." 
"I spoke of my mother, the scientist, and how she always dreamed of making the world a better place." 
"Calyx shared tales of his childhood, the laughter and love that once filled his home."

Ysella "I wish I could have known her more." 

Calyx "You're so much like her, Ysella." 

narrator "I felt a warmth in her chest, a connection that went beyond friendship." 
"I realized how much I valued Calyx' presence, how he understood me in ways others didn't."
"One night, as we lay under the stars, I turned to Calyx, my heart pounding."

Ysella "What if we don't make it to the evacuation site?" 

Calyx "What if this is it?" 
"Then we make the most of it. Together." 

narrator "He reached for my hand, intertwining our fingers. The simple touch sent a jolt through me, igniting a spark of something deeper."
"My heart skipped a beat as I looked at our entwined hands." 
"It was a small gesture, but it felt like a promise, a commitment to face whatever came their way together." 

Ysella "I like that." 

narrator "Calyx smiled, his eyes shining with a quiet intensity." 

Calyx "Me too."

narrator "The next evening, while gathering firewood, we were ambushed by a small group of zombies." 
"Panic surged through me as we fought to fend them off. We worked in sync, covering each other's backs, adrenaline coursing through our veins." 
"After the last zombie fell, we stood panting, hearts racing. The thrill of survival was overshadowed by the reality of our situation, and we shared a look that spoke volumes."

Calyx "We did it!" 

narrator Calyx breathed, relief flooding his features."

Ysella "We're okay." 
"Thanks to you,"

narrator "I said, my voice filled with emotion."
"Calyx smiled, his eyes crinkling at the corners." 

Calyx "Anytime, Ysella. We're in this together."

narrator "As we sat by the fire that night, I felt a shift in our dynamic." 
"The fear of losing each other had brought us closer, and I realized how much Calyx meant to me." 
"I turned to him, my heart pounding in her chest."

Ysella "Calyx," I don't want to just survive. I want to live."
"And I want you by my side."

narrator "Calyx turned to me, surprise evident in his eyes."

Ysella "I feel the same way, Ysella. You're my reason to keep going." 

narrator "We leaned in closer, the space between us charged with unspoken feelings, and in that moment," 
"we both knew we were no longer just friends—we were partners in every sense."
"As we continued our journey north, we faced numerous challenges, but our bond only grew stronger."
"The clearing was quiet, the only sounds were the rustling leaves and the distant call of a bird." 
"Calyx stood a few paces away from me, a determined look on his face."

Calyx "Alright, let’s work on your footwork first," 
"Good footwork is crucial in a fight. It keeps you balanced and allows you to move quickly."

narrator "I nodded, mirroring his stance." 

Ysella "Got it. What should I do?"

Calyx "Start by keeping your feet shoulder-width apart," 
"You want to be light on your feet. Try to stay relaxed but ready to move." 
"Now, practice stepping forward and back, keeping your center of gravity low."

narrator "I followed his lead, stepping forward and back, feeling the shift in my balance." 

Ysella "Like this?"

Calyx "Exactly! Now add a side step," 
"Keep your knees slightly bent, and remember to pivot on your foot."

narrator "I practiced the side step, feeling more comfortable with each movement." 

Ysella "This feels good. What’s next?"

Calyx "Let’s work on some basic strikes,"  
"Start with a simple jab. Keep your elbow in and your fist straight." 
"Aim for the target, but don’t overextend."

narrator "He demonstrated the jab, his fist slicing through the air with precision." 

Calyx "Now you try."

narrator "I took a deep breath and threw a jab, focusing on my form.

Ysella "How was that?"

Calyx "Better! But remember to follow through." 
"Now, let’s add a cross. After your jab, step forward with your back foot and throw a cross with your other hand."

narrator "I practiced the combination, feeling the rhythm of the movements." 

Ysella "Jab, cross… like this?"

Calyx "Exactly! You’re getting the hang of it," 
"Now let’s put it together with some footwork. Jab, cross, step back."

narrator "We practiced the sequence, My confidence growing with each repetition."

Ysella "This is fun!" 

narrator "Glad to hear it," 
"Now, let’s work on your defense." 
"If someone throws a punch at you, you want to block it rather than just dodge."

narrator "He demonstrated a basic block, raising his forearm to deflect an imaginary strike."

Calyx "Try it. Remember to keep your guard up."

narrator "I nodded, focusing on the movements."
"After a few attempts, I felt the rhythm of the strikes and blocks coming together." 

Ysella "How am I doing?"

Calyx "Really well." 
"Just remember, it’s not just about the moves. It’s about being aware of your surroundings and anticipating your opponent’s next move."

Ysella "Got it," 
"I’ll keep practicing."

narrator "Good. The more you practice, the more instinctive it will become," 
"You’re stronger than you think, Ysella."

narrator "As we continued our training, the bond between us deepened, forged through shared effort and trust." 
"With each strike and block, I felt more prepared for whatever lay ahead."
"We had found something special, something that would sustain us through the darkest days."
"And together, we would face whatever challenges the world had in store for us."


narrator "As we continued their journey toward the evacuation site, the sun dipped below the horizon, casting long shadows across the forest floor."
 "The air was thick with tension, and every rustle of leaves sent a shiver down my spine." 
"We had been walking for hours, our legs weary from the strain, but the thought of safety kept us moving forward."

Calyx "Just a little further." 
"We’ll make it before nightfall."

narrator "Yeah..." 
"I can almost see the lights."

narrator "But as we pushed deeper into the forest, the atmosphere shifted." 
"The trees grew denser, and the shadows seemed to come alive, creeping closer as the darkness enveloped them." 
"Suddenly, a faint sound broke through the stillness—a soft whimpering."

Ysella "What was that?" 

narrator "I whispered, my heart racing."
"Calyx halted, holding up a hand."

Calyx "Stay quiet..." 

narrator "He instructed, his eyes scanning the area. We both strained to listen, and the whimpering grew louder, morphing into a soft, pitiful cry."
"We crept closer, moving cautiously toward the source of the sound. As we rounded a thick tree trunk, we froze at the sight before us." 
"A small figure was huddled on the ground, a child—no older than six—clutching a tattered teddy bear.
"The child’s clothes were ragged, and a streak of dried blood ran down its face."

Ysella "Calyx…" 
"We can’t just leave them."

Calyx "I know," 
"But we have to be careful. We don’t know if they’re—"

narrator "Before he could finish his sentence, the child’s head snapped up, revealing hollow eyes filled with an unsettling hunger." 
"In an instant, the child lunged at us, teeth bared and a primal growl escaped its lips."

Calyx "Run!" 

narrator "Calyx shouted, but it was too late." 
"The zombie child was upon us, and in the chaos, both me and Calyx stumbled back, trying to fend off the small but relentless creature."
"Calyx swung his arm, trying to push the child away, but the zombie was fast." 
It bit down hard on his forearm, and in that moment, a sharp pain shot through my leg as the child sank its teeth into my calf."

Ysella "Ah!" 

narrator I screamed, my voice echoing through the trees as I kicked the child away, sending it sprawling to the ground." 
"The child let out a shriek, but it was quickly drowned out by the sound of more growls approaching from the darkness."

Ysella "Calyx!" 

narrator "I cried, panic rising as I looked at him." 
"The bite on his arm was already beginning to darken, and I could feel the blood seeping down my leg."

Calyx "We have to go!"

narrator "We stumbled back, adrenaline surging through our veins as we turned to run." 
"The sounds of the approaching horde echoed behind us, and as we sprinted through the underbrush, fear clawed at our insides."

Calyx "Keep moving!" 
"We can’t stop now!"

narrator "The evacuation site loomed ahead, a makeshift camp bustling with activity." 
"People were milling about, some tending to fires, others loading supplies onto trucks." 
"But as we approached, my heart sank. We were both injured, and I knew we had to get help."

Ysellla "We need to get inside!" 

narator "We burst into the camp, drawing the attention of several people nearby." 
"A tall man with a clipboard stepped forward, his expression shifting from curiosity to alarm as he took in their injuries."

Man "What happened?"

Ysella "Please! We were attacked!" 
"We need help!"

narrator "The man’s gaze flicked to Calyx, who was clutching his bleeding arm." 

Man "You both need to be checked immediately. Follow me."

narrator "As we were ushered toward a large tent, my heart raced." 
"The fear of what would happen next weighed heavily on me." 
"Will we be turned away? Will we be treated like the infected we had become?"
"Inside the tent, a flurry of activity surrounded us. Medical personnel moved swiftly, their faces set with determination." 
"A woman in a lab coat approached, her eyes widening as she recognized me." 
"It was Dr. Curie, my mom’s colleague."

Dr. Curie "Ysella?" 
"Is that you?"

narrator "My heart raced at the sound of my mother’s colleague’s voice. 

Ysella "Yes, it’s me," 
"But my mom… she’s gone. She didn’t make it."

narrator "Dr. Curie’s expression shifted from surprise to concern." 

Dr. Curie "I’m so sorry to hear that." 
"But what happened? Did she give you anything?" 
"Did she say anything about her research?"

Ysella "I don’t know. She just told me to run. I can’t remember what else she said."

narrator "Dr. Curie’s face fell, and she exchanged a worried glance with the man who had brought them in.

Dr. Curie "We need to get you both treated immediately." 
"But first, we need to assess your condition."

narrator "I felt a wave of helplessness wash over me.

Ysella "I just want to make sure we’re safe."

narrator "Dr. Curie nodded, her expression softening with understanding." 

Dr. Curie "We’ll do everything we can to help you. But we need to act quickly."

narrator "As we finished speaking, Dr. Curie turned to the man with the clipboard." 

Dr. Curie "We need to get them to the quarantine area. We can’t risk them infecting anyone else."

narrator "My heart sank as I realized our fate was all but sealed." 
"We were infected, and we will be treated as such." 
"But as I looked at Calyx, I knew we would face whatever came next together."
"We were led to the isolation tent and the atmosphere inside felt heavy with urgency and fear." 
"The medical personnel worked around us, each absorbed in their tasks, but I couldn’t shake the feeling of isolation." 
"The bright lights and sterile smells of the tent only heightened my anxiety."

Ysella "Calyx," 
"What if they can’t help us? What if we’re too late?"

narrator "Calyx gave me a reassuring nod, though his eyes betrayed his own fear." 

Calyx "We have to trust them." 
"They’re the only chance we have right now."

narrator "We reached a small area cordoned off by curtains." 
"Dr. Curie gestured for us to sit on the examination table." 

Ysella "I need to take some samples and run a few tests." 
"It’s important we know exactly what we’re dealing with."

narrator "I nodded, trying to steady my breathing."

Ysella "Okay. Just… just be quick, please."

narrator "Dr. Curie prepared her supplies, my mind raced. I thought of my mother, of the frantic moments before everything fell apart." 
"I wished I could have done more, that I could have saved her." 
"But now, all I could do was focus on the present."

Dr. Curie "Ysella, I need you to relax. This won’t hurt, I promise."

Ysella "Okay,"
"I’ll try."

narrator "She drew blood and took samples, I felt a wave of exhaustion wash over me." 
"The adrenaline that had kept me going was fading, and reality was beginning to sink in." 
"I was alone, and the weight of my loss pressed heavily on my chest."
"After what felt like an eternity, she finished her work and stepped back."

Dr. Curie "I’ll get these tested right away." 
"In the meantime, I need to ask you some questions about any symptoms you might be experiencing."

Ysella "I don’t… I don’t feel anything unusual." 
"I feel… okay, I guess. Just tired."

narrator "Her brows furrowed, and she exchanged a concerned glance with her colleague." 

Dr. Curie "That’s unusual." 
"Given the circumstances, we would expect some symptoms, especially considering the virus is affecting so many others."

narrator "Calyx shifted in his chair, his face pale." 

Calyx "I don’t feel okay," 
"I’ve got this headache, and my body feels like it’s on fire."

narrator "She turned her attention back to me." 

Dr. Curie "Did your mother do anything to you before this?" 
"Any treatments or injections that might explain your current state?"

narrator "I hesitated, my heart racing." 

Ysella "I think she did inject me with something, but I don’t know what it was."

narrator "Her expression sharpened with concern."

Dr. Curie "It’s possible that what she injected you with is the cure she was developing." 
"She was the only one with access to that treatment, it is crucial for understanding how to combat this virus."

narrator "My eyes widened as she processed the implications. Dr. Curie looked stricken." 

Dr. Curie "But when the lab was attacked, everything… it vanished." 
"I don’t know if she had time to secure her research or the remaining samples." 
"If your mother’s work was successful, you might hold the key to replicating the cure." 
"We need to analyze your blood immediately." 
"If she managed to create something effective, it could save countless lives."

narrator "Calyx looked between us, anxiety etched on his face."

Calyx "So, you’re saying Ysella might be our only hope?: 
"If her mother’s work is in her blood, could we save others?"

Dr. Curie "Yes," 
"But we need to act quickly. We have to monitor Ysella closely and run tests to fully understand the effects of whatever treatment her mother gave her." 
Time is of the essence."

narrator "I remembered that my mother had given me an extra vial, a small glimmer of hope amidst the chaos surrounding me." 
"But at that moment, my thoughts were consumed by Calyx; I didn’t want to save everyone else—I just wanted to save him." 
"The idea of being selfish, just this once, tugged at my conscience. I felt the weight of my mother’s legacy pressing down on me,"
"knowing that the vial could potentially help many, yet all I could think about was Calyx’ face, the way he smiled, and the warmth of his presence." 
"It was a battle between my desire to be selfless and the raw, undeniable pull of my heart, urging me to prioritize the one person who meant everything to me." 
"In that moment of desperation, I faced a profound dilemma," 
"to act on my love for Calyx or to honor my mother’s work by considering the greater good."


narrator "I stood at the edge of the dimly lit lab, my heart racing as I considered the gravity of our situation." 
"The air was thick with tension, and the distant sounds of chaos outside reminded me of the urgency that pressed down upon us."
"I turned to the scientist, my voice steady but laced with desperation." 

Ysella "Is it possible to replicate the cure using my blood samples?"

narrator "Dr. Curie looked up, her brow furrowed in thought."

Dr. Curie "It’s a complex process," 
"but if your blood contains the necessary antibodies, we might be able to create a viable treatment." 
"It could take days, though, and we’d need the right equipment."

narrator "I felt a flicker of hope, but it quickly dimmed as I thought of Calyx."

Ysella "And how long does it take for someone who’s been bitten to turn?" 

narrator "I pressed, urgency creeping into my tone. Dr. Curie hesitated, her expression grave."

Dr. Curie "It varies. Some can turn in mere moments, while others might take a day to a week." 
"But once the symptoms begin, it’s only a matter of time."

narrator "The weight of her words settled heavily on my shoulders." 
"The thought of Calyx, fighting against the encroaching darkness, filled me with dread."

narrator "As the shadows of the lab loomed larger, I felt the pressure of my decision bearing down on me." 
"Time was slipping away, and the undead were closing in. Should I take the risk and offer my blood for the greater good," 
"or should I hold on to hope for Calyx, even if it meant sacrificing the chance to save others?" 
"In that moment of desperation, I knew I had to decide, for the fate of those I loved hung in the balance."

narrator "Days passed in a haze of worry and despair, each one blending into the next as the world outside continued to crumble."
"Inside the isolation tent, Calyx lay on a makeshift cot, his skin pale and clammy," 
"the once vibrant spark in his eyes now dimmed by the relentless grip of the infection." 
"I could barely breathe as I watched him struggle, each labored breath a painful reminder of time slipping away."

narrator "The scientists had been working tirelessly, pouring over notes and samples, but every passing hour felt like a lifetime." 
"I often found myself at Calyx’s side, holding his hand, whispering words of encouragement that felt increasingly hollow." 
"I had already given my blood for testing, but the hope that had flickered in the beginning was fading, just like Calyx’ strength."

narrator "Then, one fateful afternoon, the door to our isolation den swung open with a loud bang." 
"Dr. Curie stormed in, her face flushed with a mix of excitement and urgency." 

Dr. Curie "I have news!" 

narrator "My heart raced as I looked up, clinging to a thread of hope."

Dr. Curie "There is indeed a cure,"
"It’s in your blood, Ysella." 
"Your unique antibodies can help us create a treatment." 
"But we need more samples—much more. We also need the vial that your mom left you." 
"I know there is one. I saw you holding it last night."

narrator "With that, I ushered Dr. Curie outside the tent to talk."

narrator "As I remembered what Dr. Curie said, my heart sank. The revelation was both exhilarating and terrifying."

Ysella "You mean… I will be able to  save him?" 

narrator "I asked, my voice barely above a whisper." 
"Everything else did not register to me, all that mattered was the thought of saving Calyx, the world, myself."

Dr. Curie "Yes." 
"But we need to act quickly." 
"The more blood we can collect, the better our chances of replicating the cure." 
"However, it will be a strain on you."

narrator "The thought of losing Calyx was unbearable, yet the idea of giving more of myself felt daunting." 

Ysella "What if something happens to me?"

Dr. Curie "We don’t have time to waste." 
"If we don’t act now, we might lose him entirely." 
"This could be the breakthrough we’ve been waiting for."

narrator "I felt a surge of conflicting emotions. The weight of my decision pressed heavily on my shoulders." 
"I could sacrifice my own well-being for the chance to save Calyx," 
"to save others, or I could hold back, fearing the unknown consequences."

Ysella

narrator "Dr. Curie looked at me with a mix of concern and urgency."

Dr. Curie "Ysella, time is not on our side. Every minute counts. If you’re going to use the serum, we need to act fast."

Ysella "I understand," 

narrator "Dr. Curie sighed, running a hand through her hair." 

Dr. Curie "I can’t guarantee anything, but the serum is our best chance."

Ysella "I know. I just… I need to talk to him first. I need to see him."

Dr. Curie "Very well," 
"You have a few moments. But make it quick. We don’t have much time."

narrator "Taking a deep breath, I turned and headed back inside the isolation tent." 
"The chaos of the evacuation camp swirled around me, but all I could focus on was Calyx—his face pale," 
"the bite mark on his arm darkening with each passing moment. I had to know what he wanted before I made my choice."
 "I spotted him in the corner of the isolation tent, waving weakly as I approached."

Calyx "Calyx!" 

narrator "He forced a smile, but it didn’t reach his eyes." 

Calyx "Hey, Ysella. I’m still here, but… I don’t think I’m going to make it anymore."

Ysella "No! You can’t say that!" 
"We’ll find a way to fix this!" 

narrator "Calyx shook his head slowly, the weight of reality settling heavily between us." 

Calyx "You don’t understand. The infection is spreading too fast. I can feel it. It’s only a matter of time."

narrator "My heart sank, panic clawing at my throat. 

Ysella "We can get you treated! There has to be something we can do!"

narrator "He looked at me, his expression softening, yet resolute." 

Calyx "Ysella, listen to me. You have to save yourself." 
"You can’t waste the serum on me. There are others who need it more." 
"I’ve seen the way they look at you. You’re their hope."

narrator "Tears streamed down my face as I clutched the vial tighter." 

Ysella "But what if it could save you? What if we could still fight this together?"

narrator "Calyx’ eyes glistened with unshed tears." 

Calyx "It’s not just about me anymore. You have to be strong." 
"If you care about me, you’ll do what’s right. You can’t let my fate hold you back."

narrator "The chaos outside grew louder, the sounds of panic echoing through the tent." 
"I felt my resolve wavering, torn between my love for him and the harsh reality we faced."

Ysella "I can’t just leave you here!" 
"You’re my best friend, my motivation, my inspiration to keep going! You mean everything to me!"

narrator "He reached for my hand, his grip weak but steady."

Calyx "And you mean everything to me too."
