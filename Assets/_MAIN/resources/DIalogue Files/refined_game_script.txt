Ysella Mira "Mom! What’s going on? I don’t understand!" I cried, my heart racing as I watched her hastily pull out vial after vial from a cooler she had brought from work. 

narrator "Sweat trickled down her forehead, and her hands shook with urgency."

Ema "You will soon, my Mira. Sit, please,"

narrator "she urged, her voice strained as she uncapped the vials, preparing her syringe."

Ysella Mira "Mom, what’s that? Please, tell me!" I pleaded, my voice trembling as I sank into the dining chair. I felt a chill run down my spine, sensing something was terribly wrong."

Ema "I don’t have time!"

narrator "She snapped, rolling the sleeves of my favorite pink ‘Nirvana’ shirt up. The sight made my heart ache. With swift movements, she began injecting the contents of each vial into me, except for one."

Ema "Keep this with you. Be careful not to break it, okay?"

narrator "She pressed the last vial into my palm, her eyes locking onto mine, desperate and pleading. 

Ema "You have to trust me."

narrator "Tears streamed down my cheeks as I nodded, my heart pounding in my chest. I had a sinking feeling about what was going to happen next."
"Suddenly, I saw her grimace in pain, clutching her arm. "Mom, what’s going on? Please!" I rushed to her side, panic surging through me."

Ema "Just hold on, Mira. You know how to drive my car, right? Take this and go to that address on the paper." Her shaking hands reached into her pocket, and she handed me an envelope along with the keys to her Toyota Vios."

Ysella Mira "Mom, no! I can’t leave you!" I cried, my voice cracking, but she shook her head, urgency etched on her face."

Ema "You have to! There’s no time! This is bigger than us!" Her voice was firm, but I saw the fear in her eyes. 

Ema "Promise me you’ll go."

Ysella Mira "I promise, but—"

Ema "Go!" 

narrator "She shouted, her voice cutting through my hesitation like a knife." 
"Desperation clawed at my heart as I watched her turn and run toward the backyard, screaming in pain." 
"My breath caught in my throat as I stood frozen, heart racing, until her scream faded into silence."

narrator "With blurry vision from my tears, I stumbled toward the garage, adrenaline propelling me as I drove to the address on the piece of paper inside the envelope."

Lyon "Ysella, wake up. We need to leave!" A hand shook me awake, and I blinked, disoriented."

Ysella "Dad—what’s happening?" I stammered, my heart pounding."

Lyon "The virus is spreading!" he shouted, urgency in his voice. I felt a jolt of fear shoot through me."

narrator "I scrambled out of bed, gathering my emergency bag, strapping it on my back as I rushed outside. I saw my dad ushering his wife and my little siblings to the car."

Lyon "Get in, now!" he commanded, his eyes wild with fear."

Ysella "Where are we heading?" I asked, breathless, as I climbed into the backseat."

Lyon "To the evacuation site. It’s up north," he replied, determination etched into his features."

narrator "As we drove, my aunt turned on the radio, and the panicked voice of the disc jockey filled the car."
"There have been hundreds of reported cases of this unnamed virus quickly spreading in our town."
"This is not an ordinary cough and cold virus; this may be one of the ones we are all dreading. It can turn the infected into the living dead.
"The scientists are working on creating a cure fast. For now, we encourage all residents to evacuate and move up north. The government has set up a relocation site—"
"Suddenly, the radio crackled with static, and the DJ’s scream pierced the air, prompting my aunt to quickly turn it off."

Lyon "Shit!" Dad muttered, gripping the steering wheel tighter. "We need to find fuel. This isn’t good."

Samantha "What? What’s going on?" 

narrator "Aunt asked, her voice trembling."

Lyon "We ran out of gas, but I’m sure there’s a fuel station nearby," he replied, trying to mask his panic."

Ysella "Dad, no! It’s too risky to go out!" I begged, hugging my two little siblings, who were now crying beside me."

Lyon "We have no choice!" He slammed the steering wheel in frustration, and I felt my heart drop."

narrator "We pulled up to the nearest fuel station, the silence around us deafening. The place was empty; no one was there."
"Even the convenience store inside seemed to have been ransacked. The neon sign flickers ominously, and the front doors were shattered."

Lyon "Okay, here’s the plan," 

narrator "Dad said, his voice steady but laced with urgency. 

Lyon "Your aunt and I will go in. I’ll get us some gasoline while she gathers the supplies we need." 
"When we go out, you’ll transfer to the driver’s seat and strap the kids into the passenger seat.
"It’s easier to get inside from the backseat. Got it?" 

narrator "He looked at me, and I could see the fear in his eyes, mirroring my own."

narrator "Tears brimmed in my eyes as I nodded, my heart racing. 

Ysella "But what if something happens to you?" I whispered, the dread pooling in my stomach."

Lyon "Nothing will happen. Just stay alert," he reassured me, though his voice wavered slightly."

narrator "As they stepped out of the car, I watched them disappear into the shadows of the fuel station, my heart pounding in my chest."

narrator "The silence was suffocating, and I clutched my siblings tightly, trying to keep them calm. 

Ysella "It’s going to be okay," 

narrator "I whispered, though I wasn’t sure I believed it."
"Minutes felt like hours as I waited, my mind racing with worst-case scenarios." 
"Suddenly, I heard a loud crash from inside the station, and my heart dropped."

Ysella "Dad?" 

narrator "I called out, my voice trembling."

Lyon "Stay in the car!" he shouted back, but his tone was strained, and I could hear the panic creeping in."

Ysella "Please, hurry!" I begged, my voice breaking as I glanced at my siblings, who were now wide-eyed with fear."

narrator "The silence in the car grew heavier as the minutes ticked by. 

narrator "Just as I was about to lose hope, Dad and Aunt burst through the doors of the gas station, their faces pale and eyes wide with terror."

Lyon "Get in! Now!" Dad yelled, and I scrambled to switch seats, my heart racing as I buckled my siblings in."

Ysella "What happened?" 

narrator "I asked, my voice barely above a whisper."

Lyon "They were infected inside! We need to go—now!" 

narrator "He slammed the door shut, and I could see the fear etched on his face as he turned the key in the ignition."

narrator "The engine roared to life, and we sped away from the desolate fuel station, the world outside a blur. But as we drove, I could see the panic in Dad’s eyes."

Ysella "Where to now?" I asked, my voice shaking."

Lyon "We need to find another gas station," 

narrator "he replied, gripping the steering wheel tightly. 

Lyon "We can’t risk running out of fuel again."

narrator "As we drove further away from the chaos, I felt a mix of relief and dread."
"The radio crackled to life, the DJ’s frantic voice filling the car again. "
"We are receiving reports of chaos in the streets."
'Residents are urged to stay indoors and avoid contact with anyone showing symptoms. The situation is escalating rapidly—"

Ysella "Turn it off!" 

narrator "I shouted, unable to bear the weight of the news. My dad complied, and the silence that followed was heavy with unspoken fears."

Lyon "Just keep driving north."

narrator "He said, determination etched into his features. 

Lyon "There has to be another station not too far from here."

narrator "Minutes felt like hours, but eventually, we spotted the flickering lights of another gas station in the distance."
"My heart raced with hope as we pulled into the lot. This station looked more intact than the last, with the convenience store still standing and no signs of chaos outside."

Lyon "Okay, same plan as before," 

narrator "Dad said, his voice steady but urgent." 

Lyon "I’ll go inside with your aunt, and you stay with the kids. If we’re not back in ten minutes, drive away."

narrator "I nodded, my heart pounding in my chest. I didn’t want to lose them, but I knew we had no choice."

narrator "As they stepped out of the car, I ushered my siblings to the front seat, strapping them in tightly." 
"I kept my eyes glued to the entrance of the station, praying they would return quickly."

narrator "With every passing second, my anxiety grew. The world outside felt too quiet, too still." 
"I could feel the weight of my siblings’ trust resting on my shoulders, and I was terrified of letting them down."

narrator "5 minutes."

narrator "I gripped the steering wheel tightly as I muttered a silent prayer for them. My knuckles are turning white and my heartbeat is racing." 
"I strain to hear something, anything. I blink the tears that are starting to cloud my vision again. They have to come back. They have to."

narrator "10 minutes."

Ysella "Where are they? 

narrator "I squirmed in my seat as I let go of the steering and started to fidget. Sweat is trickling down from my forehead. 

narrator "The deafening silence outside is suffocating. Though I can’t breathe properly from the anticipation, I can’t let my siblings see how vulnerable I am."

narrator "My mind starts to race with images of what could have gone wrong—what if they’re hurt? What if… No, I can’t think about that."

narrator "15 minutes."

narrator "Panic starts to rise as I see no signs of them still. I keep replaying my dad's words in my head,

narrator "Be brave."

narrator "But how can I be brave when I feel like I’m about to lose them? I look at my siblings, tears welling up in their eyes, trusting me to protect them, to know what to do.

narrator "But I don’t know what to do. I don’t want to leave. I don’t want to lose them."

narrator "My pulse is pounding in my ears now. Just a few more minutes. They’ll come back. Won’t they?"

narrator "Nothing. I couldn’t hear anything. My siblings started to cry, I was on the verge of breaking down again but dad said that I had to be brave."

Ysella "Shhh, it’s okay. They’ll be back. We’ll stay for a couple minutes more, okay? They are coming back." I assured them but I don't even know if they will be back."

narrator "2 more minutes."

narrator "My fingers trembled even more, sweating and couldn’t even grip the steering wheel tightly. The only thing I could hear are our shaky breaths."

narrator "I try to calm them but I know that I was calming myself more through them." 
"I stare out at the fuel station, straining to catch a glimpse of them—anything, any sign of movement." 
"They said they'd be back. Please, just come back."

narrator "5 more minutes."
"I don’t know how much longer I can wait. Every fiber of my being screams for me to leave, to do what dad told me."
"But the idea of driving away, of abandoning them, of not knowing what happened—it feels like a weight pressing down on my chest, making it hard to breathe. 
"Tears sting my eyes, but I bite my lip hard, trying to hold them back. I can’t break. Not now. Not in front of the kids."
"I looked up and saw two figures emerging from the convenience store, sprinting towards the car when Aunt accidentally stepped on a can, the sound echoing through the desolate station. 

Ysella "Come on, please." 

narrator "I whispered, desperation creeping into my voice as snarls filled the air, accompanied by the pounding of footsteps, frantic shouts, and the loud banging of objects."

narrator "Before Dad could close the door, a hand shot out, grabbing it and yanking it open. 

Infected Civilian "Let me in! Please, let me in!" a man pleaded, his eyes wide with fear as he tried to force his way inside."

Lyon "No, no. We’re full. I’m sorry, but you need to find someone else who can help you," 

narrator "Dad argued, though the man was relentless. I caught a glimpse of the man’s left arm, a bite-like wound turning grayish, the teeth marks and dried blood stark against his skin."

Ysella "Dad, his left hand!" 

narrator "I screamed, and everyone turned to look."

Infected Civilian "No, this is just a baby bite! My toddler bit me two days ago. Please, let me in! I need to get home to my babies,"

narrator "he cried, tears streaming down his face as he begged again."

Samantha "I’m sorry, but you’re infected. I understand your fear, but we have kids inside too. We can’t let you in," 

narrator "Aunt reasoned, her voice steady yet sympathetic. The man, however, used all his strength to pull the door open."

narrator "Dad gripped it tighter, slamming it shut, causing the man’s fingers to get wedged in the door, slicing through flesh and bone."

narrator "He screamed, a sound that sent chills down my spine, and then the snarls grew louder."

Lyon "Ysella, drive now!" 

narrator "Dad commanded as I clicked the lock button, securing all the doors, and slammed my foot on the gas."

narrator "The man’s cries for help echoed in my ears as the zombies descended upon him, their growls mingling with his screams."

narrator "Aunt broke the tension with a dark quip, "Throw the damn fingers out the window, Lyon," which earned a nervous laugh from all of us."

Ysella "Careful, Dad. We’re not touching blood or any fluids from that person," 

narrator "I warned as he picked up the severed fingers with a plastic bag and tossed them out the window with a grimace."

narrator "On the next mile, Dad and I switched places, knowing he had a better sense of direction."

Andy "Dad, I need to go to the bathroom," 

narrator "one of the twins piped up."

Ashley "Me too, Dad," 

narrator "the other twin chimed in, their voices filled with urgency."

Lyon "Okay, we’re stopping at the next fuel station. I don’t think the zombies have reached there yet," he replied."

narrator "After another mile, we pulled into a fuel station in the next town, where I could still see people moving about. It seemed like the zombies hadn’t made it here yet."

narrator "He ushered the kids outside, instructing Aunt to accompany the twins while he scouted the area. I stepped out too, drawn to the candy store adjacent to the fuel station."

narrator "I scanned the shelves and spotted my favorite nerd clusters." 

narrator "Just as I reached for the only box, someone swiftly snatched it from the shelf." 

Calyx "Sorry, this one’s mine," 

narrator "a guy’s voice pulled me back to reality, and I glared at him, imagining how I would punish the thief."  

Ysella "I saw that first," 

narrator "I retorted, looking up to meet a pair of familiar eyes. Wait, I know this person."

narrator "He raised an eyebrow, a smirk playing on his lips. 

Calyx "What?"

Ysella "I know you. You look familiar," 

narrator "I said, squinting as I tried to place him. 

narrator "Then it clicked."

Ysella "Calyx?!"

narrator "​​The sun hung low in the sky, casting a golden glow over the sprawling park where laughter danced on the breeze."

narrator "Teenagers filled the space, but amidst the chatter and noise, Ysella and Calyx found their own little world beneath a sprawling oak tree, its branches providing a canopy of shade."

narrator "Calyx sprawled on the grass, his hands tucked behind his head, a carefree grin lighting up his face." 

Calyx "I dare you to climb to the top of that tree," 

narrator "he challenged, nodding toward the towering oak."

narrator "Ysella raised an eyebrow, a playful smirk forming on her lips." 

Ysella "You think I can’t do it?"

Calyx "Not a chance," 

narrator "he replied, mockingly shaking his head. "You’re too scared of heights."

Ysella "Scared? Please." 

narrator "She tossed her hair back, her competitive spirit ignited."

Ysella "Watch me."

narrator "With a determined glint in her eyes, Ysella scrambled up the rough bark, her fingers finding familiar holds. 

narrator "The world below shrank as she climbed higher, the thrill of the challenge coursing through her veins. 

narrator "She reached a sturdy branch and paused, looking down at Calyx, who was now a tiny figure on the ground."

Ysella "See? Not scared at all!" 

narrator "she called down, her voice filled with exhilaration."

Calyx "Okay, okay! You win!" 

Calyx "shouted back, laughter bubbling up as he shielded his eyes from the sun." 

narrator "Just don’t fall! I’m not ready to be a tree surgeon."

narrator "Ysella laughed, her heart racing not just from the climb but from the joy of the moment." She felt invincible, suspended between childhood and the unknown future. 

narrator "As she perched on the branch, the wind tousled her hair, and she felt a sense of freedom that was intoxicating."

Ysella "Come up here!" 

narrator "She urged, gesturing for him to join her."

Ysella "It’s amazing!"

Calyx "Yeah, right! I’m not climbing that thing. I’d rather keep my feet on solid ground," 

narrator "he replied, shaking his head, but his eyes sparkled with admiration."

Ysella "Chicken!" 

narrator "she teased, sticking her tongue out at him."

narrator "Calyx rolled his eyes but couldn’t help but smile." 

Calyx "Maybe I just have a better sense of self-preservation."

Ysella "Or maybe you’re just afraid I’ll beat you at everything," 

narrator "she shot back, laughing as she swung her legs playfully."

narrator "Okay, you got me there," he admitted, his expression turning serious for a moment. "But seriously, be careful up there. I don’t want to have to explain to your parents how you got yourself stuck in a tree."

narrator "Ysella felt a warmth spread through her at his concern. "You worry too much, Calyx. I’ll be fine."

narrator "She climbed a little higher, feeling the rush of adrenaline and the thrill of the challenge. Just as she reached for another branch, her foot slipped, and she gasped, scrambling to regain her balance."

Ysella "Whoa!"

narrator "Calyx’s eyes widened, and he sprang to his feet, his voice filled with urgency."

Calyx "Ysella! Hold on!"

narrator "With a burst of instinct, she managed to grip the branch tighter, steadying herself. Heart pounding, she looked down at him, and in that moment, their eyes locked."

narrator "The world around them faded, and all that mattered was the connection they shared."

Calyx "You’re okay!" 

narrator "he called, relief flooding his voice." 

Calyx "Just take your time!"

narrator "After a few deep breaths, Ysella found her footing again and carefully made her way back down, her heart racing not just from the climb but from the intensity of their gaze."

narrator "When she finally reached the ground, she was met with Calyx’s outstretched arms, ready to catch her if she fell."

Ysella "See? I told you I’d be fine," 

narrator "she said, a triumphant grin spreading across her face."

Calyx "Yeah, but you scared the life out of me," 

narrator "he replied, his breath still shaky. "You’re lucky I’m here to keep you out of trouble."

Ysella "Or maybe you’re just lucky to have me around,"

narrator "she teased, nudging him playfully."

Lyon "Ysella! There you are, we need to go," 

narrator "Dad barged into the candy store, pulling me away from Calyx."

Ysella "Dad, wait—" 

narrator "I protested, tugging him back."

Lyon "We don’t have time. They’re coming," 

narrator "he insisted."

Calyx "Can I go with you?"

narrator "I heard a voice behind me, and Dad turned to look at Calyx, surprise etched on his face."

Lyon "Calyx?" 

narrator "He was shocked but quickly agreed."

Lyon "Sure, come on. The car is this way." 

narrator "He led us outside, but when we reached the parking spot, our car was gone."

narrator "In the distance, the sound of resounding footsteps echoed like an army marching, accompanied by snarls and the unmistakable stench of the living dead. 

Lyon "Shit!" 

narrator "Dad muttered, panic creeping into his voice."

Calyx "My car is this way," 

narrator "Calyx said, but Dad was too busy scanning the area. I tugged at him, urgency rising in my chest."

Ysella "Dad! Dad!"

narrator "He turned to me, his voice firm yet laced with an underlying panic."

Lyon "The twins, my wife, Ysella! We need to find them."

Ysella "We will find them, Dad. But for now, we need to get inside the car," 

narrator "I urged him, trying to keep him focused."

narrator "We slid into Calyx’s car, and he immediately locked all the doors behind us."

narrator "The parade of footsteps grew louder, each second bringing the threat closer." 

Lyon "We can’t leave, Calyx. I need to find them," 

narrator "Dad insisted, his eyes darting out the window as he searched for any sign of them." 

narrator "I closed my eyes, whispering a prayer for their safety."

narrator "Calyx rummaged through his glove compartment and handed me a can. 

Ysella "What is this?" 

narrator "I asked, reading the label that said "Zombie Perf" in messy handwriting."

Calyx "It makes you smell like zombies, so they won’t know you’re human and alive," 

narrator "he explained, leaning back and massaging his temples, exhaustion evident on his face."

narrator "I couldn’t help but chuckle. 

Ysella "Why do we need this?"

Calyx "Because I ran out of fuel and we need to transfer to another car."

Ysella "Why didn’t you tell us? We could’ve gone straight to another car," 

narrator "I replied, slumping back against the seat, frustration bubbling inside me."

Lyon "Chill, guys," 

narrator "Dad interjected, placing his hands between us. He shot me a warning look before turning to Calyx."

Lyon "We need to stay focused."

Ysella "How am I supposed to chill, Dad? Aunt and the twins are missing, this car doesn’t even have any fuel, and we’re here thinking it could take us somewhere far from here."

Ysella "Now we’re going to brave that horde of zombies while relying on this?" 

narrator "I raised the can in annoyance."

Lyon "I know, Ysella. I’m with you on this. I’m pissed, annoyed, and whatever else too, but being rash and not thinking it through can get us killed."

Lyon "We need to calm down and plan," 

narrator "Dad replied, returning his watchful gaze to the window."

Ysella "I’m sorry, okay!? I panicked, so I got us here. Would you rather go out there and search the whole place for your missing car than seek shelter elsewhere?"

Ysella "If it bothered you so much that I didn’t tell you about my car running out of fuel, then I’ll just unlock these doors and go scavenging for your car, your aunt, and the twins." 

Calyx "Go ahead, get yourself killed." 

narrator "With a forceful click, he unlocked all the doors."

Ysella "What the heck?!" 

narrator "I exclaimed, staring at him in disbelief."

Calyx "Yes. What the heck, right? Get out," 

narrator "he said flatly, exasperation evident in his tone."

Lyon "Calm down, okay? Now is not the time for this," 

narrator "Dad interjected again, trying to diffuse the tension."

Ysella "What are we gonna do now?" 

narrator "I asked, panic rising as the snarls grew louder. I glanced at the back of the car and saw the herd of zombies parading the streets."

narrator "Calyx instructed us to spray the perfume, handing me and Dad some gloves before putting one on himself. 

Calyx "Just spray the perfume now. Here, wear this,"

narrator "he said, urgency in his voice."

Calyx "Trust me. I made that," 

narrator "he added, nodding toward the can as he prepared himself."

narrator "With a grunt, I sprayed the foul-smelling substance on myself, the stench overwhelming but necessary, and then passed it to them."

narrator :I could see Dad grimace as he applied it, but we all knew it was our only chance. As I looked out the window, the shadows of the zombies loomed closer, and I felt a surge of determination."

Ysella "Let’s do this," 

narrator I said, steeling myself for whatever lay ahead."

narrator "As the foul stench settled on me, I felt my stomach churn. I pinched my nose and glared at Calyx,"

Ysella "This better work."

Calyx "Trust me, it will," 

narrator "Calyx said, though there was an edge in his voice."

narrator He sounded unsure, but there was no time for doubt now."

narrator "My dad opened the door cautiously, peeking out into the street."

Lyon "Remember, slow movements. Act like them." 

narrator "His voice was calm, but I could see the tremor in his hand as he clutched the door handle."

narrator "The groaning of the undead grew louder, and my heart was thumping so fast I thought it might burst out of my chest.

narrator "I looked at the horde ahead of us—some were missing limbs, their faces distorted into expressions of hunger and pain."

Lyon "We’re going to walk through them," 

narrator "Dad whispered, his eyes focused ahead, not daring to look at me." 

Lyon "Head towards the alley across the street. We’ll look for another vehicle or shelter."

narrator "Calyx gave a stiff nod. 

Lyon "Stick close. If one of them gets too close, just keep moving."

narrator "I grabbed Dad’s hand and held on tightly. I knew I had to be brave, but the sight of those lifeless creatures stumbling around made it almost impossible."

narrator "Every step we took closer to them, I could feel the fear tightening in my chest."

narrator "We stepped out of the car, and the stench of death hit me full force. I tried to stay calm, breathing through my mouth to avoid gagging, but it was hard to pretend I was one of them.

narrator "My hands were shaking, my pulse racing with each step."

narrator "One of the zombies shuffled right past me, its eyes lifeless, its mouth slightly agape. I could smell the decay, hear its ragged breathing.

narrator "The urge to run was overwhelming, but I forced myself to move slowly."

narrator "We were almost halfway through the horde when I heard a crash behind us."

narrator "My heart froze, and I turned slowly to see a zombie knocking over a trash can. It snarled as its bloodshot eyes locked onto us."

Calyx "Don’t react," 

narrator "Calyx whispered harshly."

Calyx "Keep walking."

narrator "But the zombie started to stumble towards us, its grotesque mouth open, teeth bared."

narrator "I gripped Dad’s hand even tighter, my breaths coming out ragged as I tried to hold back the terror threatening to consume me."

narrator "The zombie got closer, its groans getting louder as it sniffed the air around us."

Calyx "It’s testing us," 

narrator "Calyx muttered under his breath. "Just a few more steps..."

narrator "But then the zombie lunged."

Lyon "Run!"

narrator "Dad yelled, shoving me forward as the undead creature snarled and lunged towards us."

narrator "The rest of the horde turned their heads in our direction, sensing the movement and life."

narrator "We barreled down the street, leaving the growls and screeches of the undead far behind us."

narrator "We made it across the street, the herd of zombies continuing to stumble by." 

narrator "Once we were behind the cover of an abandoned building, Calyx waved us over."

Ysella "That was close!" 

narrator "I whispered, barely able to contain my relief."

narrator "Dad nodded, his expression still taut with worry. 

Ysella "Now what?"

Calyx "We need another car, something with fuel. There should be a lot around here; this area wasn’t hit as hard as the others,"

narrator "Calyx replied, his voice low. He wiped the sweat from his brow, his eyes scanning the dimly lit street ahead."

Ysella "What about Aunt and the twins?" 

narrator "I asked, my voice cracking as the weight of the situation settled over me again."

narrator "The thought of leaving them behind, of not knowing what had happened to them, gnawed at my insides."

narrator "Dad looked torn, his jaw clenched. He turned to me, his eyes filled with anguish." 

Lyon "We have to move forward, Ysella. We’ll find them, but we can’t stay here."

narrator "I nodded, biting back the tears threatening to spill again. I didn’t want to leave. I didn’t want to accept that they might be gone.

narrator "But there was no choice. Survival meant hard decisions."

narrator "Calyx took the lead again, guiding us through the streets."

narrator "We passed abandoned cars, their windows shattered, belongings scattered on the ground like remnants of a life that no longer existed."

narrator "After a few tense minutes, Calyx stopped in front of a small SUV parked behind a gas station.

narrator "It looked relatively untouched. He tried the door—unlocked."

Calyx "We’re in luck." 

narrator "He said quietly. He opened the driver’s side and slid in, checking the gas gauge."

Calyx "Half a tank. We’ll make it far with this."

narrator "Dad ushered me into the backseat, and I buckled in, my body still trembling from the close encounter."

narrator "As Calyx started the engine, the low hum was a welcome sound amidst the chaos of snarls and footsteps fading in the distance."

narrator "Just as we were about to pull away, a frantic barking echoed from the shadows."

narrator "I turned to see a large black dog darting toward us, its thick fur matted and eyes wide with fear."

narrator "It skidded to a stop beside the car, looking up at us with desperate hope."

Ysella "Should we let it in?" 

narrator "I asked, my heart aching at the sight of the frightened creature."

narrator "Calyx hesitated, glancing at the dog."

Calyx "We can’t just leave it here." 

narrator "He said, his voice filled with urgency. Without waiting for a reply, he leaned over and opened the door."

narrator "The dog jumped in, panting heavily, as if it had been running for its life."

narrator "It settled in the footwell, looking up at us with a mix of gratitude and fear."

narrator "We drove off into the night, leaving behind the wreckage, the screams, and the uncertainty."

narrator "My heart ached for Aunt and the twins, but I clung to the hope that somehow, we’d reunite.

narrator "For now, though, all I could do was be brave. Just like Dad told me."

narrator "At that moment, I promised myself I wouldn’t let fear stop me. Not from finding them, not from surviving, and not from fighting until the end."

narrator "The streets blurred by as we sped into the night, the car's headlights cutting through the darkness."

narrator "My thoughts were a chaotic jumble, replaying the events that had just unfolded. I leaned my head against the cool window, seeking solace in the chill."

Ysella "Where are we going?" 

narrator "I asked, breaking the silence."

Calyx "Anywhere but here..." 

narrator "Calyx replied, his grip tightening on the steering wheel."

Calyx "We’ll find a safe spot to regroup." 

narrator "I could see the determination in his eyes, mirroring the resolve building within me. 

narrator "We were in this together, and I had to trust that we’d figure it out."

narrator "The wind whipped past, carrying with it the scent of rain. I felt the weight of uncertainty settle on my shoulders."

Ysella "Do you think they’re okay?" 

narrator "I asked, my voice barely a whisper."

narrator "Calyx glanced at me, his expression softening."

Calyx "We’ll find them. I promise."

narrator "The dog sat quietly in the footwell, its massive head resting on its paws. It seemed to understand the urgency of our situation, and a quiet calm settled over the car."

narrator "The tension in the air eased slightly, replaced by a sense of shared purpose."

narrator "I reached out and gently stroked the dog's head, offering a small comfort. It turned its head to look at me, its black eyes filled with an unreadable depth."

narrator "The dog was a silent companion in our journey, a symbol of hope and resilience."

narrator "In the darkness outside, the city was a maze of shadows and danger. But inside the car, there was a fragile sense of unity, of shared hardship and determination."

narrator "The dog, a stranger only moments before, had become a symbol of our own fight for survival. We were not alone."

narrator "The road ahead was uncertain, but for now, we were moving, and we were together."

narrator "As we drove deeper into the night, the distant sounds of chaos faded, replaced by the steady rhythm of our breaths."

narrator "I closed my eyes for a moment, grounding myself in the promise of survival, the flickering hope that fueled my resolve."

narrator "The road eventually narrowed, leading us away from the town and into the dense embrace of the forest."

narrator "Just as the buildings began to fade into the distance, I spotted a small, dilapidated store on the side of the road, its flickering neon sign barely illuminating the darkness."

Calyx "Let’s check it out!" 

narrator "Calyx suggested, his voice laced with cautious optimism. 

Calyx "We might find some supplies."

narrator "He slowed the car and parked, and we stepped out into the cool night air."

narrator "Dad remained in the car to keep watch along with Coal– we decided to name the dog that. He stared out the window, his dark eyes reflecting the flickering neon sign.

narrator "His presence was reassuring, a silent guardian against the encroaching darkness."

narrator "The forest was alive with the sounds of rustling leaves and distant chirps, but the store stood eerily silent, its windows dark and cracked."

narrator "My heart raced with both fear and curiosity." 

Ysella "What if they find us here?"

Calyx "We’ll be careful..." 

narrator "Calyx assured me, glancing around as we approached the entrance." 

Calyx "But we need to see what’s inside."

narrator "As we pushed open the creaking door, the smell of dust and decay filled the air."

narrator "We stepped inside, the dim light revealing empty shelves and scattered debris."

narrator "Just as I began to feel a sense of calm, a sudden rustling from the back of the store caught our attention."

Ysella "Did you hear that?" 

narrator "I whispered, my heart racing."

narrator "Before we could react, a group of rough-looking survivors emerged from the shadows, their faces hardened and eyes cold."

narrator "They were armed, and the tension in the air became palpable."

Calyx "Looks like we’re not alone," 

narrator "Calyx said, his body tensing as he positioned himself protectively in front of me."

Man "Hey!" one of the men called out, stepping forward, his voice dripping with hostility. "What are you doing here?"

narrator "I felt a knot form in my stomach as I realized we were cornered. "We’re just passing through," I said, trying to keep my voice steady. "We’re looking for supplies."

narrator "The man let out a harsh laugh, glancing at his companions. "Supplies? You think we’re just going to let you waltz in and take what’s ours?"

narrator "Calyx stepped forward, his voice calm but firm." 

Calyx "We don’t want trouble. We’re just trying to survive, like everyone else."

Calyx "We’ve seen the chaos out there. We’re all in the same boat."

narrator "The man’s expression shifted slightly, a flicker of understanding crossing his face."

Man "And what makes you think we’ll just let you take what you want?"

Ysella "Because we know what it’s like," 

narrator "I interjected, my heart pounding." 

Ysella "We’ve lost people too. We’re not here to fight or take what isn’t ours. We just need enough to keep going."

Ysella "If you let us take what we need, we can keep moving and avoid drawing attention to this place."

narrator "Calyx nodded in agreement." 

Calyx "We’re all trying to survive in this hellhole. If we can help each other, it’s better for everyone."

narrator "The leader of the group hesitated, looking at his companions. After a tense moment, he lowered his weapon slightly."

Man "Alright. Take what you need, but be quick about it. We can’t afford to attract any unwanted attention."

narrator "Relief washed over me, but I remained cautious." 

Ysella "Thank you. We won’t be long."

narrator "We moved through the store, gathering what we could—canned food, a couple of water bottles, and a few first-aid supplies."

narrator "The other survivors watched us closely, their expressions a mix of wariness and reluctant acceptance."

narrator "Once we had what we needed, we returned to the front of the store."

Calyx "We appreciate this," 

narrator "Calyx said sincerely."

Calyx "We’ll be on our way now."

Man "Just remember, we’re all in this together," 

narrator "the leader replied, his voice softer now."

Man "Stay safe out there."

narrator "As we stepped back outside, the cool night air felt like a breath of fresh hope."

narrator "I glanced back at the store, gratitude swelling in my chest for the understanding we had found."

narrator "As we climbed into the car, I allowed myself a small smile. 

narrator "We did it."

narrator "Calyx nodded, starting the engine."

Calyx "But we need to stay vigilant. This world is unpredictable."

narrator "As we drove away from the store, the weight of our narrow escape hung in the air, mingling with the relief of having secured some supplies."

narrator "The road ahead was dark and winding, the trees looming like silent sentinels on either side."

narrator "I stole a glance at Calyx, who was focused on the road, his jaw set in determination."

narrator "We should find a place to rest," Dad said after a few moments, breaking the silence. "Somewhere off the main road, away from prying eyes."

narrator "I nodded, feeling the fatigue seep into my bones."

Ysella "Agreed. Let’s just keep moving until we find a good spot."

narrator "After a short drive, we spotted a small clearing just off the road, sheltered by thick underbrush and the towering trees."

narrator "Calyx parked the car and we stepped out, the cool night air wrapping around us like a blanket."

narrator "The sounds of the forest filled the space, a gentle reminder that we were not alone, even in our solitude."

narrator "We settled on the ground, leaning against the car as we unpacked our meager meal. The supplies we had taken from the store were sparse, but they would sustain us for the moment."

narrator "Each crunch echoed in the silence, reminding me of how different life had been just hours before."

Ysella "Do you think we should start a fire?"

narrator "I asked, glancing around at the darkness enveloping us."

narrator "Calyx nodded." 

Calyx "It’ll keep us warm and help us stay alert. Plus, it’ll give us a bit of light."

narrator "He and Dad gathered some twigs and leaves, and after a few attempts, a small flame flickered to life."

narrator "The warmth spread through me, and I watched as the light danced, casting shadows that seemed to play tricks on my mind."

narrator "As we settled around the fire, I reached down to pat Coal, the dog who had joined us on this chaotic journey."

narrator "His thick fur was comforting beneath my fingers, and I could feel the tension in his body gradually easing as he leaned into my touch."

Ysella "Hey, boy..." 

narrator "I whispered, my voice softening as I scratched behind his ears."

Ysella "You’re a brave one, aren’t you?"

narrator "Coal looked up at me with his wide, expressive eyes, as if he understood every word."

narrator "In that moment, he felt like a guardian, a silent protector in this unpredictable world." 

narrator "I glanced over at my dad, who was staring into the flames, lost in thought."

Ysella "Dad," 

narrator "I said, my voice breaking the quiet."

Ysella "Do you think Mom would have liked him?"

narrator "Calyx, sensing the weight of our conversation, nodded and quietly stepped back."

narrator "He turned and walked toward the path leading back to the car, leaving the two of us surrounded by the towering trees and the soft rustle of leaves."

narrator "He looked up, a hint of surprise flickering across his face."

Lyon "Your mom loved animals." 

narrator "He replied, a small smile creeping onto his lips."

Lyon "I remember when we got our first dog together. She was so excited, she could hardly contain herself. I think she would have adored Coal."

narrator "I smiled at the thought, imagining my mom laughing as she played with a dog like Coal."

Ysella "I wish I could remember her better..." 

narrator "I admitted, my fingers still gently stroking Coal’s fur. "Sometimes it feels like I’m losing pieces of her."

narrator "Dad shifted his gaze back to the fire, the flames reflecting in his eyes." 

Lyon "You’re not losing her, Ysella. She’s a part of you, always. Every time you show bravery, every time you care for someone, that’s her in you."

narrator "I nodded, feeling a warmth spread through me that had nothing to do with the fire."

Ysella "I want to be brave, Dad. Just like you said. Just like Coal."

narrator "He chuckled softly, glancing at the dog." 

Lyon "Well, you’ve got a good role model right here. Look at him— he’s ready to protect us no matter what."

narrator "Coal lifted his head and let out a low, reassuring bark, as if he understood the weight of our conversation."

narrator "I couldn’t help but smile at him, feeling a sense of comfort in his presence."

Ysella "Yeah, he really is something special," 

narrator "I said, giving Coal another gentle pat."

Ysella "I think he’s going to help us get through this."

narrator "Dad nodded, his expression serious but proud."

Lyon "You’re right. We need to stick together, all of us. We’ll find a way to keep moving forward, and we’ll do it as a team."

narrator "The fire crackled, sending sparks into the night sky, and I felt a renewed sense of hope."

narrator "With Coal by our side and my dad’s unwavering support, I knew we could face whatever challenges lay ahead."

Ysella "Let’s make a promise," 

narrator I suggested, looking at my dad. 

Ysella "No matter what happens, we’ll always look out for each other. And for Coal."

narrator "He smiled, a glimmer of determination in his eyes."

Lyon "I promise, Ysella. We’ll always have each other’s backs."

narrator "As I continued to stroke Coal’s fur, I felt a bond forming between us—a connection that transcended the chaos surrounding us."

narrator "In that moment, I knew we were not just fighting for survival;"

narrator "we were fighting for family, for love, and for the memories of those we had lost."

narrator "For a moment, neither spoke again, the silence between us filled by the steady warmth of the bonfire."

narrator "Finally, Dad broke the quiet, his voice low and contemplative."

Lyon "Your mom and I… we met in a place not much different from this."

Lyon "Your mom... she was everything." 

narrator "He added, his voice soft and thick with memory." 

Lyon "We met by accident, but it felt like destiny—like we were meant to find each other in the chaos of life."

Lyon "She could light up any room with her smile, even when everything was falling apart."

narrator "I looked up, surprised. It wasn’t often that he mentioned my mom,"

narrator "I knew because he never did when I was in their house, especially not in the middle of a chaotic night like this."

narrator "He stared into the flames, his eyes reflecting memories she couldn’t see."

Lyon "It was… unexpected. We were young, wild, full of ideas of what life could be. I thought we could make it work, no matter what."

narrator "I listened intently, the warmth of the fire almost soothing, despite the turmoil that had become our lives." 

Lyon "I loved her deeply, but love doesn’t always mean forever."

Lyon "Sometimes... people are meant to cross paths for a while and then..."

Lyon "they have to take different roads." 

narrator "His eyes glistened as he stared into the flames."

Lyon "We tried. We really did."

narrator "He paused, smiling faintly."

Lyon "One night, she convinced me to sneak onto this rooftop."

Lyon "She said she wanted to watch the stars, but really, she just wanted to laugh at how bad I was at climbing." 

narrator "His chuckle was low and soft. 

Lyon "It was so ridiculous, but I was happy. Those moments... they mattered more than anything else."

narrator "My throat tightened at the thought of my mother whom I barely remembered. 

Ysella "What happened? Why didn’t it work?" 

narrator "I asked quietly."

narrator "Dad sighed, running a hand through his hair."

Lyon "Life just got in the way. I wasn’t ready for the responsibility. I thought I had time to figure it all out, but time slipped away."

Lyon "And in the end, your mom deserves someone who was fully there for her—something I couldn’t be." He looked at me then, his gaze full of regret."

Lyon "But I’ll never stop loving her. She gave me you."

narrator "He glanced at me, the firelight catching in his eyes."

Lyon "It wasn’t because we didn’t care. We just couldn’t…"

Lyon "find a way to make it last."

narrator "I felt a knot form in his chest."

narrator "For all the times I’d wondered why they weren’t together, I’d never really asked him."

narrator "But hearing him now, it wasn’t anger that I felt—it was a deep understanding."

narrator "He looked down at the fire, a wistful smile tugging at his lips as memories flickered in his eyes."

Lyon "I remember the way she laughed when I first taught her how to drive.

Lyon "We were out in the middle of nowhere, much like tonight."

Lyon "She stalled the car so many times, but she never gave up. She was determined, stubborn even."

Lyon "It’s one of the things I loved most about her."

narrator "He paused, the crackling of the fire filling the space between them."

Lyon "There was this one night, we sat on the hood of the car, under the stars, talking about everything and nothing."

Lyon "She told me that if we ever had a daughter, she hoped she’d be brave. Just like you."

narrator "He glanced at me, his voice softening." 

Lyon "She was always dreaming, always thinking about a future where everything worked out."

narrator "Dad stared into the fire, his voice growing softer."

Lyon "I just… I want you to know something, Ysella."

Lyon "I’ve learned to love your stepmother—she’s a good woman, and she’s been there for me."

Lyon "But there wasn’t a single day that I didn’t think about your mom."

Lyon "I still love her."

Lyon "I always will." 

Lyon "She was the kind of person who leaves a mark on your heart, no matter how much time passes."

narrator "He sighed, the weight of the years pressing down on him." 

Lyon "But sometimes, no matter how much you love someone, life pulls you in different directions."

Lyon "It doesn’t mean the love wasn’t real. It just means… it wasn’t meant to last."

narrator "I swallowed hard, my heart heavy yet strangely lightened by his words."

narrator "As my dad’s memories wove through the air, it felt as if a piece of my mom had come alive again, if only for a moment."

narrator "And in that moment, by the bonfire, while the world outside still teetered on the edge of chaos, I felt something deep inside me begin to heal."

narrator "As the fire burned low, the warmth slowly faded, silence settled between me and dad."

narrator "It wasn’t an uncomfortable silence—more like the quiet that comes after a storm, when everything feels a little clearer."

narrator "The night around us was still, save for the occasional rustle of leaves or the distant howl of some unseen creature.

narrator "I gazed up at the stars, the sky seeming so vast, so indifferent to everything happening below."

narrator "I felt small, but at the same time, anchored by my dad’s presence."

Ysella "You think she’d be proud of me?" 

narrator "I whispered, almost afraid to ask."

narrator "Dad didn’t answer right away."

narrator "Instead, he stirred the embers with a stick, watching the sparks fly up into the dark sky."

narrator "She’d be more than proud, Ysella. She’d be in awe."

narrator "I gave his dad a smile–one that conveys gratitude and affection."

narrator "We sat in silence for a moment longer before Calyx returned, his figure emerging from the shadows."

Calyx "Here’s some water and food." 

narrator "He said, his voice low but steady."

Calyx "We’ll need to keep moving soon."

narrator "Dad nodded."

Lyon "We should rest for a few more hours, then head out at dawn."

narrator "But the peace was short-lived."

narrator "A snap echoed from the woods, a sound too sharp, too deliberate."

narrator "Dad stiffened immediately, eyes narrowing as he scanned the treeline."

Lyon "Stay behind me!" 

Lyon "He ordered in a low, urgent voice, rising to his feet."

narrator "The snap turned into a rustling, followed by the unmistakable sound of hurried footsteps approaching from the shadows."

narrator "Calyx stood up quickly, already tense and alert. We exchanged a glance, and my heart began to race."

narrator "Before I could even react, figures burst out from the trees, shadowy and swift, their faces hidden in the dark."

narrator "There were too many to count."

Lyon "Run!" 

narrator "Dad shouted, pushing me back toward the car. His voice cut through the confusion like a sharp blade."

narrator "My legs felt rooted to the ground, terror freezing me in place as I watched the strangers close in."

narrator "Dad grabbed a thick branch from the ground, swinging it fiercely to keep them at bay."

narrator "One of them lunged forward, only to be met with a sharp blow that sent them stumbling back.

narrator "But they weren’t deterred."

Lyon "Go! Now!" 

narrator "He yelled again, his voice a mixture of desperation and command."

narrator "His eyes flicked to me, full of urgency and something that looked like finality."

narrator "Calyx grabbed my arm, pulling me toward the car, but the strangers were quick—too quick."

narrator "One blocked our path, and another darted around the car, cutting off any chance of escape."

narrator "Dad roared, charging forward with reckless abandon, swinging the branch wildly."

narrator "He knocked two of them down, his movements fueled by sheer will, but more kept coming."

narrator "Then, just as the situation seemed most dire, Coal sprang into action."

narrator "The large black dog, who had been resting near the car, leaped forward, barking fiercely as he positioned himself between dad and the approaching strangers."

narrator "His powerful frame and loud barks caught them off guard, buying a precious moment for dad."

Lyon "Coal! Get back!" 

narrator "Dad shouted, but the dog stood his ground, teeth bared, ready to protect."

narrator "I felt a surge of hope as Coal charged at one of the strangers, knocking him off balance and creating a brief opening."

Ysella "Dad! We can get away!" 

narrator "I cried, my heart racing with renewed determination."

narrator "But my father was still engaged in a fierce struggle, grappling with another attacker on the ground."

narrator "Coal continued to fight valiantly, darting between the strangers, barking and snapping, trying to keep them at bay."

Lyon "Go!" 

narrator "Dad yelled again, his voice hoarse."
"Calyx pulled me away, but I couldn’t tear her eyes away from the scene unfolding before me."
"Coal was doing everything he could, but the odds were against him."
"Then, it happened too fast."
"One of the strangers, faster and larger than the others, tackled my dad to the ground."
"They struggled, the branch knocked from his hands as they rolled in the dirt."
"Coal lunged at the attacker, teeth bared, but another stranger grabbed him by the collar, pulling him away just as dad landed a solid punch."

Ysella "Dad!" 

narrator "I screamed, my voice hoarse, breaking as I took a step toward him."
"Calyx pulled me back again forcefully this time, nearly dragging me as we scrambled into the forest.

Calyx "We can’t stay, Ysella! We have to go!"

narrator "I struggled against him, my body twisting, trying to break free, but it was too late."
"Dad’s figure was barely visible now." 
"The stranger holding him down, and then—he disappeared."
"The last thing I saw was my father being dragged into the dark forest, swallowed by the shadows."
"His final, desperate shout echoed in my ears, burning into her mind."
"Go!"
"In that moment, I felt a pang of helplessness, but Coal’s fierce barking cut through the chaos."
"The dog was fighting with everything he had, but the odds were stacked against him."

Ysella "Coal!" 

narrator "I cried, my heart breaking as I watched the scene unfold."
"Calyx’s grip tightened on my arm, pulling me through the trees, but I couldn’t tear my gaze away."
"I wanted to turn back, to fight for my dad and for Coal, but they had no choice."
"The darkness of the forest consumed us, leaving behind the distant crackling of the dying bonfire and the crushing silence of my father's absence."
"As we ran through the forest, the darkness seemed to swallow us whole. I stumbled over roots and fallen branches, my heart racing with every snap and creak of the trees."
"Calyx's grip on my arm was like a vice, pulling me forward as we desperately tried to escape."
"We didn't dare look back, fearing what we might see. The strangers' shouts and footsteps grew fainter, but I knew they could catch up to us at any moment."
"My legs burned, my lungs heaved, and my mind reeled with the image of my dad being dragged away, and now Coal, too, caught in the chaos."
"Eventually, Calyx slowed to a stop, his chest heaving as he listened intently."
"I strained my ears, but all I could hear was the distant howling of wolves and the creaking of trees in the wind."

Calyx "We need to keep moving." 

narrator "Calyx whispered, his eyes scanning the surroundings."

Calyx "We can't stay here."

narrator "The moon hung high in the sky, casting a silvery glow over the forest as I sat on a fallen log, my hands trembling in my lap."

narrator "The events of the day replayed in my mind like a relentless loop—shouts, chaos, the sound of metal clashing, and the moment I had lost control."

narrator "I could still hear the cries of those who had fought alongside me, the weight of their loss pressing down on my chest."

narrator "Calyx approached quietly, sensing the heaviness in the air."

Calyx "Ysella?" 

Calyx "Are you okay?"

narrator "I looked up, my eyes glistening with unshed tears."

Ysella "No," 

narrator "I whispered, my voice breaking."

Ysella "I can’t shake it off. I thought I was ready for this…"
"but I wasn’t. I couldn’t save them."

narrator "Calyx’s heart ached at the sight of my distress."

Calyx "You did everything you could..." 

narrator "He said gently, placing a reassuring hand on my back."

Calyx "You fought bravely."
"It wasn’t your fault."

narrator "But the words felt hollow to me."

Ysella "I should have been better. I should have seen it coming." 

narrator "A single tear slipped down my cheek, and I wiped it away angrily, as if trying to erase the pain."

Calyx "Hey," 
"It’s okay to feel this way. You’re human. You care, and that makes you stronger, not weaker."

narrator "I shook my head, frustration bubbling up inside me."

Ysella "I feel so helpless. I wanted to protect everyone, and instead, I just… I just watched."

narrator "Calyx turned to face me fully, his expression earnest."

Calyx "You’re not helpless, Ysella. You’ve faced so much and kept going."
"It’s okay to break down sometimes. It doesn’t mean you’re weak; it means you’re alive."

narrator "His words pierced through my turmoil, and I felt the floodgates open."

Ysella "I’m scared, Calyx,"  
"I’m scared of failing again. I don’t want to lose anyone else."

narrator "Calyx moved closer, wrapping an arm around my shoulders."

Calyx "You won’t lose me. I promise." 
"We’re in this together, and I’ll always be by your side."

narrator "I leaned into him, the warmth of his presence grounding me."

Ysella "What if I can’t do this?" 

narrator "I whispered, my vulnerability laid bare."

Calyx "You can," 
"You’ve shown so much strength already, and it’s okay to lean on others when you’re feeling weak." 
"We all have our moments of doubt, but that doesn’t define who we are."

narrator "As Calyx spoke, I felt the tension in my chest begin to ease, if only slightly. I took a shaky breath, trying to absorb his words."
 
Ysella "But what if I let you down?" 

Calyx "You won’t. We’re a team, and we learn from each other." 
"If you stumble, I’ll be right there to catch you. You’re not alone in this."

narrator "Tears streamed down my cheeks, and I let them fall freely now, the weight of my emotions crashing over me like a wave."

Ysella "I just feel so lost sometimes," 
"I want to be strong, to protect everyone, but I don’t know if I can do it."

Calyx "You don’t have to have all the answers," 
"Strength isn’t about never feeling fear or doubt; it’s about facing those feelings and pushing through them." 
"You’re stronger than you realize, Ysella. You’ve fought through so much already."

narrator "I leaned my head against him, finding solace in his presence." 

Ysella "I don’t want to be a burden," 

narrator "You could never be a burden," 
"You bring so much to me. It’s okay to let yourself feel, to be vulnerable." 
"That’s how we grow."

narrator "As the night wore on, the stars twinkling above them, I felt a flicker of hope igniting within me."
"Calyx’s unwavering support wrapped around me like a warm blanket, easing the ache in my heart." 

Ysella "Thank you for being here."

Calyx "Always..." 
"You’re not just a warrior; you’re a friend, more than that, actually."
 "And friends support each other through thick and thin."

narrator "With a deep breath, I closed my eyes, allowing the moment to wash over me." 
"The weight of my fears didn’t vanish entirely, but it felt lighter now, shared with someone who truly understood."
"I nodded and stood up, still trying to process what had just happened." 
"My dad, the man I barely knew but had just begun to connect with, was gone." 
"The thought sent a wave of grief crashing over me, and I felt my knees buckle."
"Calyx caught me, holding me upright as I sobbed uncontrollably. 

Calyx "I'm sorry, Ysella," 
"I'm so sorry."

narrator "I didn’t know how long we stood there, but eventually, Calyx gently pulled me forward, urging me to keep moving."
"We walked in silence, the only sound being the rustling of leaves and the distant howling of wolves."
"As we walked, memories of my dad flooded my mind, though they were few and far between."
"I recalled the rare moments we had shared—his warm smile when he first saw me, the way he awkwardly tried to connect with me, the stories he told about my mom." 
"I felt a deep ache in my chest, a longing for the father-daughter bond I had always wished for but never fully experienced."
"The pain of losing him was like a weight crushing me, making it hard to breathe." 
"I felt guilty for not having more memories, for not being able to protect him, for not being able to save him." 
"I felt angry at the strangers who had taken him away, at the world for being so cruel."
"Calyx' hand found mine, his fingers intertwined with mine as we walked." 
"It was a small comfort, but it was something. I squeezed his hand, trying to convey my gratitude without words."
"We walked for what felt like hours, the darkness slowly giving way to a faint light on the horizon."
"As the sun began to rise, casting a golden glow over the forest, I felt a sense of determination rising within me."
"I would survive this. I would find a way to make it through this apocalypse, no matter what it took." 
"And I would make sure that my dad's sacrifice wasn't in vain, even if our time together had been so short."
"I looked up at Calyx, his eyes meeting mine with a glimmer of understanding. We didn't need to say a word; we both knew what we had to do." 
"We would keep moving, keep fighting, until we found a way to reclaim our world."
"Together, we walked towards the rising sun, our footsteps quiet on the forest floor." 
"The journey ahead would be long and hard, but with Calyx by my side, I felt a sense of hope that I hadn't felt in a long time."
"As we walked, the silence between us was comfortable, a testament to the bond we'd formed in the midst of chaos." 
"The forest seemed to stretch on forever, the trees growing taller and the underbrush thicker with every step." 
"I was starting to lose hope, wondering if we'd ever find a place to call safe, when Calyx suddenly stopped."

Calyx "Look!" 

narrator "I followed his gaze, and my heart skipped a beat as I saw it—a small, secluded cabin nestled among the trees." 
"Smoke drifted lazily from the chimney, and a faint light flickered in the window."
"Calyx' grip on my hand tightened as we approached the cabin, our senses on high alert for any signs of danger." 
"But as we drew closer, I sensed a strange feeling—peace. It was as if the cabin was a haven, a sanctuary from the madness that had consumed the world."
"We exchanged a look, and without a word, we crept towards the cabin, our footsteps quiet on the forest floor." 
"Calyx pushed open the creaky door, and we stepped inside, our eyes adjusting to the warm, golden light."
"The cabin was small, but it was cozy, with a fire crackling in the hearth and a kettle simmering on the stove." 
"A small table in the center of the room was set with two chairs, and a single candle cast a warm glow over the space."
"Calyx let out a slow breath, his shoulders relaxing as he took in the surroundings." 

Calyx "This is it." 
"This is where we can rest, where we can be safe."

narrator "I nodded, feeling a sense of relief wash over me. We'd found a haven, a place to call our own, if only for a little while."
"As we sat down at the table, Calyx' eyes met mine, and for a moment, we just looked at each other, the silence between us speaking volumes."
"Then, without warning, Calyx spoke up, his voice low and gentle." 

Calyx "Ysella, I know how you're feeling right now. Lost, scared, and angry all at once."

narrator "I nodded, feeling a lump form in my throat. 

Ysella "How did you know?"

narrator "Calyx' eyes dropped, his gaze fixed on the table as he began to speak." 

Calyx "I've been there too, Ysella. I've lost people I loved, people who were taken from me too soon."
"I sensed a deep sadness in his voice, a pain that he'd carried with him for a long time."

Calyx "My parents, they died when I was young, and my grandparents took me in." 
"I was too young to understand what was happening, but I knew I had to leave the neighborhood." 
"I couldn't stay in a place that held so many memories of them."

narrator "I felt a pang of empathy, a sense of connection to Calyx that I hadn't felt before." 
"As I looked into his eyes, I saw a glimmer of something more, something that went beyond mere friendship." 
"It was a spark that I thought had long been extinguished, a spark of affection that I had felt for Calyx before he left the neighborhood."
 "As I gazed at him, I realized that the spark had never truly gone away. It had been smoldering beneath the surface, waiting to be fanned back into flame." 
"And now, as I looked at Calyx, I felt it ignite once more."

Calyx "I never got to say goodbye to you, Ysella," 
"I'm sorry I left without a word. But I'm glad we're together now, Ysella." 
"We can face this together, as long as we have each other."

narrator "As he spoke, his eyes locked onto mine, and I felt a flutter in my chest." 
"It was a feeling I couldn't quite explain, a sense of attraction that I hadn't expected." 
"But it was also a feeling that I had known before, a feeling that I had thought was lost forever."

Ysella "I'm glad we're together too, Calyx," 

narrator "Calyx' eyes crinkled at the corners as he smiled, and I felt my heart skip a beat." 
"It was a small moment, but it was enough to make me realize that my feelings for Calyx went far beyond mere friendship."
"As we sat there, the silence between us was no longer uncomfortable."
"Instead, it was filled with a sense of possibility, a sense that we might just find something more in this desolate world."
"Just then, we heard a faint noise behind us. We turned to see an old lady standing in the doorway, her expression a mix of surprise and suspicion."

Agnes "What are you doing in my cabin?"
"Have you been bitten?"

narrator "I felt a wave of panic wash over me. 

Ysella "No, we haven't! We were just looking for a safe place to rest."

narrator "The old lady narrowed her eyes, taking a cautious step forward." 

Agnes "You can't be too careful these days. I’ve seen too many people turn after being bitten." 
"I won’t let you bring danger into my home."

narrator "Calyx raised his hands in a gesture of peace." 

Calyx "We understand your concern. We just need a place to rest for a day." 
"We can help you defend this cabin if anything happens."

narrator "Agnes studied us for a moment, her gaze piercing. Finally, she sighed, her expression softening just a fraction."

Agnes "Fine. You can stay for one night. But if I see anything suspicious, you’re out."

narrator "Relieved, we settled in, grateful for the warmth of the cabin and the chance to catch our breath." 
"As the evening wore on, Calyx and I shared stories, and I felt a growing bond between us." 
"Agnes, though skeptical, occasionally joined our conversation, her demeanor gradually softening as she listened to our tales of survival."
 "However, the peace was short-lived. In the early hours of the morning, a distant growl echoed through the woods, followed by a chorus of moans." 
"My heart raced as I realized what it was—a horde of zombies was approaching."
"Agnes’ eyes widened with fear. 

Agnes "We need to barricade the door!"

narrator "Calyx and I rushed to help, but it was too late." 
"The horde had already surrounded the cabin, their relentless pounding on the door threatening to break it down."
"Agnes’ face is set in a determined expression." 

Agnes "I'll hold them off. You two need to get out of here, find a way to escape."

narrator "Calyx and I exchanged a horrified glance." 

Ysella "No, Agnes, we can't leave you!" 

narrator "Agnes’ eyes locked on mine, a deep sadness in their depths." 

Agnes "I'm old, Ysella. I've lived my life. I've seen the world." 
"You two have a chance to make a difference." 
"Don't waste it."

narrator "With a heavy heart, Calyx and I reluctantly agreed." 
"As we made our way to the back door, Agnes stood tall, a fierce determination in her eyes."

Ysella "I'll hold them off as long as I can," 
"Get out of here, and don't look back."

narrator "With a final glance at Agnes, we fled into the darkness, the sounds of the zombie horde and Agnes’ defiant cries echoing behind us."
"As we trekked through the dense forest, the air was thick with tension and the scent of damp earth." 
"We had been traveling for days, our only company was the rustling leaves and the distant echoes of the undead." 
"Each step felt heavier than the last, but we pressed on, motivated by the hope of reaching the evacuation site."

narrator "One afternoon, we stumbled upon an abandoned cabin. Cautiously, we entered, scanning for any useful supplies. The silence was palpable as we searched, every creak of the floorboards making them jump. My heart raced as I rummaged through the cabinets, my hand brushing against Calyx' as we reached for the same can of food."

narrator "Our eyes met, and for a moment, the weight of our situation faded. We shared a quiet smile, a flicker of warmth amidst the chaos. "Sorry about that," I said, my voice barely above a whisper. Calyx chuckled, his eyes crinkling at the corners. "It's okay. I think we're both a little on edge."
narrator "Later that night, we set up camp in a small clearing. The darkness enveloped us, and the sounds of the forest felt menacing. My heart raced as shadows danced around us, my imagination running wild with worst-case scenarios. Calyx noticed my unease and moved closer, wrapping an arm around my shoulders. "Hey, it's just the wind," he whispered, his voice steady. "I'm here."
 "I leaned into him, feeling a sense of safety I hadn't felt in a long time. I closed my eyes, letting the warmth of his body seep into mine." 

Ysella "Thanks, Calyx," 
"I don't know what I'd do without you."

narrator "As we sat by the fire, we began to share their stories—fears, dreams, and memories of happier times." 
"I spoke of my mother, the scientist, and how she always dreamed of making the world a better place." 
"Calyx shared tales of his childhood, the laughter and love that once filled his home."

Ysella "I wish I could have known her more." 

Calyx "You're so much like her, Ysella." 

narrator "I felt a warmth in her chest, a connection that went beyond friendship." 
"I realized how much I valued Calyx' presence, how he understood me in ways others didn't."
"One night, as we lay under the stars, I turned to Calyx, my heart pounding."

Ysella "What if we don't make it to the evacuation site?" 

Calyx "What if this is it?" 
"Then we make the most of it. Together." 

narrator "He reached for my hand, intertwining our fingers. The simple touch sent a jolt through me, igniting a spark of something deeper."
"My heart skipped a beat as I looked at our entwined hands." 
"It was a small gesture, but it felt like a promise, a commitment to face whatever came their way together." 

Ysella "I like that." 

narrator "Calyx smiled, his eyes shining with a quiet intensity." 

Calyx "Me too."

narrator "The next evening, while gathering firewood, we were ambushed by a small group of zombies." 
"Panic surged through me as we fought to fend them off. We worked in sync, covering each other's backs, adrenaline coursing through our veins." 
"After the last zombie fell, we stood panting, hearts racing. The thrill of survival was overshadowed by the reality of our situation, and we shared a look that spoke volumes."

Calyx "We did it!" 

narrator Calyx breathed, relief flooding his features."

Ysella "We're okay." 
"Thanks to you,"

narrator "I said, my voice filled with emotion."
"Calyx smiled, his eyes crinkling at the corners." 

Calyx "Anytime, Ysella. We're in this together."

narrator "As we sat by the fire that night, I felt a shift in our dynamic." 
"The fear of losing each other had brought us closer, and I realized how much Calyx meant to me." 
"I turned to him, my heart pounding in her chest."

Ysella "Calyx," I don't want to just survive. I want to live."
"And I want you by my side."

narrator "Calyx turned to me, surprise evident in his eyes."

Ysella "I feel the same way, Ysella. You're my reason to keep going." 

narrator "We leaned in closer, the space between us charged with unspoken feelings, and in that moment," 
"we both knew we were no longer just friends—we were partners in every sense."
"As we continued our journey north, we faced numerous challenges, but our bond only grew stronger."
"The clearing was quiet, the only sounds were the rustling leaves and the distant call of a bird." 
"Calyx stood a few paces away from me, a determined look on his face."

Calyx "Alright, let’s work on your footwork first," 
"Good footwork is crucial in a fight. It keeps you balanced and allows you to move quickly."

narrator "I nodded, mirroring his stance." 

Ysella "Got it. What should I do?"

Calyx "Start by keeping your feet shoulder-width apart," 
"You want to be light on your feet. Try to stay relaxed but ready to move." 
"Now, practice stepping forward and back, keeping your center of gravity low."

narrator "I followed his lead, stepping forward and back, feeling the shift in my balance." 

Ysella "Like this?"

Calyx "Exactly! Now add a side step," 
"Keep your knees slightly bent, and remember to pivot on your foot."

narrator "I practiced the side step, feeling more comfortable with each movement." 

Ysella "This feels good. What’s next?"

Calyx "Let’s work on some basic strikes,"  
"Start with a simple jab. Keep your elbow in and your fist straight." 
"Aim for the target, but don’t overextend."

narrator "He demonstrated the jab, his fist slicing through the air with precision." 

Calyx "Now you try."

narrator "I took a deep breath and threw a jab, focusing on my form.

Ysella "How was that?"

Calyx "Better! But remember to follow through." 
"Now, let’s add a cross. After your jab, step forward with your back foot and throw a cross with your other hand."

narrator "I practiced the combination, feeling the rhythm of the movements." 

Ysella "Jab, cross… like this?"

Calyx "Exactly! You’re getting the hang of it," 
"Now let’s put it together with some footwork. Jab, cross, step back."

narrator "We practiced the sequence, My confidence growing with each repetition."

Ysella "This is fun!" 

narrator "Glad to hear it," 
"Now, let’s work on your defense." 
"If someone throws a punch at you, you want to block it rather than just dodge."

narrator "He demonstrated a basic block, raising his forearm to deflect an imaginary strike."

Calyx "Try it. Remember to keep your guard up."

narrator "I nodded, focusing on the movements."
"After a few attempts, I felt the rhythm of the strikes and blocks coming together." 

Ysella "How am I doing?"

Calyx "Really well." 
"Just remember, it’s not just about the moves. It’s about being aware of your surroundings and anticipating your opponent’s next move."

Ysella "Got it," 
"I’ll keep practicing."

narrator "Good. The more you practice, the more instinctive it will become," 
"You’re stronger than you think, Ysella."

narrator "As we continued our training, the bond between us deepened, forged through shared effort and trust." 
"With each strike and block, I felt more prepared for whatever lay ahead."
"We had found something special, something that would sustain us through the darkest days."
"And together, we would face whatever challenges the world had in store for us."


narrator "As we continued their journey toward the evacuation site, the sun dipped below the horizon, casting long shadows across the forest floor."
 "The air was thick with tension, and every rustle of leaves sent a shiver down my spine." 
"We had been walking for hours, our legs weary from the strain, but the thought of safety kept us moving forward."

Calyx "Just a little further." 
"We’ll make it before nightfall."

narrator "Yeah..." 
"I can almost see the lights."

narrator "But as we pushed deeper into the forest, the atmosphere shifted." 
"The trees grew denser, and the shadows seemed to come alive, creeping closer as the darkness enveloped them." 
"Suddenly, a faint sound broke through the stillness—a soft whimpering."

Ysella "What was that?" 

narrator "I whispered, my heart racing."
"Calyx halted, holding up a hand."

Calyx "Stay quiet..." 

narrator "He instructed, his eyes scanning the area. We both strained to listen, and the whimpering grew louder, morphing into a soft, pitiful cry."
"We crept closer, moving cautiously toward the source of the sound. As we rounded a thick tree trunk, we froze at the sight before us." 
"A small figure was huddled on the ground, a child—no older than six—clutching a tattered teddy bear.
"The child’s clothes were ragged, and a streak of dried blood ran down its face."

Ysella "Calyx…" 
"We can’t just leave them."

Calyx "I know," 
"But we have to be careful. We don’t know if they’re—"

narrator "Before he could finish his sentence, the child’s head snapped up, revealing hollow eyes filled with an unsettling hunger." 
"In an instant, the child lunged at us, teeth bared and a primal growl escaped its lips."

Calyx "Run!" 

narrator "Calyx shouted, but it was too late." 
"The zombie child was upon us, and in the chaos, both me and Calyx stumbled back, trying to fend off the small but relentless creature."
"Calyx swung his arm, trying to push the child away, but the zombie was fast." 
It bit down hard on his forearm, and in that moment, a sharp pain shot through my leg as the child sank its teeth into my calf."

Ysella "Ah!" 

narrator I screamed, my voice echoing through the trees as I kicked the child away, sending it sprawling to the ground." 
"The child let out a shriek, but it was quickly drowned out by the sound of more growls approaching from the darkness."

Ysella "Calyx!" 

narrator "I cried, panic rising as I looked at him." 
"The bite on his arm was already beginning to darken, and I could feel the blood seeping down my leg."

Calyx "We have to go!"

narrator "We stumbled back, adrenaline surging through our veins as we turned to run." 
"The sounds of the approaching horde echoed behind us, and as we sprinted through the underbrush, fear clawed at our insides."

Calyx "Keep moving!" 
"We can’t stop now!"

narrator "The evacuation site loomed ahead, a makeshift camp bustling with activity." 
"People were milling about, some tending to fires, others loading supplies onto trucks." 
"But as we approached, my heart sank. We were both injured, and I knew we had to get help."

Ysellla "We need to get inside!" 

narator "We burst into the camp, drawing the attention of several people nearby." 
"A tall man with a clipboard stepped forward, his expression shifting from curiosity to alarm as he took in their injuries."

Man "What happened?"

Ysella "Please! We were attacked!" 
"We need help!"

narrator "The man’s gaze flicked to Calyx, who was clutching his bleeding arm." 

Man "You both need to be checked immediately. Follow me."

narrator "As we were ushered toward a large tent, my heart raced." 
"The fear of what would happen next weighed heavily on me." 
"Will we be turned away? Will we be treated like the infected we had become?"
"Inside the tent, a flurry of activity surrounded us. Medical personnel moved swiftly, their faces set with determination." 
"A woman in a lab coat approached, her eyes widening as she recognized me." 
"It was Dr. Curie, my mom’s colleague."

Dr. Curie "Ysella?" 
"Is that you?"

narrator "My heart raced at the sound of my mother’s colleague’s voice. 

Ysella "Yes, it’s me," 
"But my mom… she’s gone. She didn’t make it."

narrator "Dr. Curie’s expression shifted from surprise to concern." 

Dr. Curie "I’m so sorry to hear that." 
"But what happened? Did she give you anything?" 
"Did she say anything about her research?"

Ysella "I don’t know. She just told me to run. I can’t remember what else she said."

narrator "Dr. Curie’s face fell, and she exchanged a worried glance with the man who had brought them in.

Dr. Curie "We need to get you both treated immediately." 
"But first, we need to assess your condition."

narrator "I felt a wave of helplessness wash over me.

Ysella "I just want to make sure we’re safe."

narrator "Dr. Curie nodded, her expression softening with understanding." 

Dr. Curie "We’ll do everything we can to help you. But we need to act quickly."

narrator "As we finished speaking, Dr. Curie turned to the man with the clipboard." 

Dr. Curie "We need to get them to the quarantine area. We can’t risk them infecting anyone else."

narrator "My heart sank as I realized our fate was all but sealed." 
"We were infected, and we will be treated as such." 
"But as I looked at Calyx, I knew we would face whatever came next together."
"We were led to the isolation tent and the atmosphere inside felt heavy with urgency and fear." 
"The medical personnel worked around us, each absorbed in their tasks, but I couldn’t shake the feeling of isolation." 
"The bright lights and sterile smells of the tent only heightened my anxiety."

Ysella "Calyx," 
"What if they can’t help us? What if we’re too late?"

narrator "Calyx gave me a reassuring nod, though his eyes betrayed his own fear." 

Calyx "We have to trust them." 
"They’re the only chance we have right now."

narrator "We reached a small area cordoned off by curtains." 
"Dr. Curie gestured for us to sit on the examination table." 

Ysella "I need to take some samples and run a few tests." 
"It’s important we know exactly what we’re dealing with."

narrator "I nodded, trying to steady my breathing."

Ysella "Okay. Just… just be quick, please."

narrator "Dr. Curie prepared her supplies, my mind raced. I thought of my mother, of the frantic moments before everything fell apart." 
"I wished I could have done more, that I could have saved her." 
"But now, all I could do was focus on the present."

Dr. Curie "Ysella, I need you to relax. This won’t hurt, I promise."

Ysella "Okay,"
"I’ll try."

narrator "She drew blood and took samples, I felt a wave of exhaustion wash over me." 
"The adrenaline that had kept me going was fading, and reality was beginning to sink in." 
"I was alone, and the weight of my loss pressed heavily on my chest."
"After what felt like an eternity, she finished her work and stepped back."

Dr. Curie "I’ll get these tested right away." 
"In the meantime, I need to ask you some questions about any symptoms you might be experiencing."

Ysella "I don’t… I don’t feel anything unusual." 
"I feel… okay, I guess. Just tired."

narrator "Her brows furrowed, and she exchanged a concerned glance with her colleague." 

Dr. Curie "That’s unusual." 
"Given the circumstances, we would expect some symptoms, especially considering the virus is affecting so many others."

narrator "Calyx shifted in his chair, his face pale." 

Calyx "I don’t feel okay," 
"I’ve got this headache, and my body feels like it’s on fire."

narrator "She turned her attention back to me." 

Dr. Curie "Did your mother do anything to you before this?" 
"Any treatments or injections that might explain your current state?"

narrator "I hesitated, my heart racing." 

Ysella "I think she did inject me with something, but I don’t know what it was."

narrator "Her expression sharpened with concern."

Dr. Curie "It’s possible that what she injected you with is the cure she was developing." 
"She was the only one with access to that treatment, it is crucial for understanding how to combat this virus."

narrator "My eyes widened as she processed the implications. Dr. Curie looked stricken." 

Dr. Curie "But when the lab was attacked, everything… it vanished." 
"I don’t know if she had time to secure her research or the remaining samples." 
"If your mother’s work was successful, you might hold the key to replicating the cure." 
"We need to analyze your blood immediately." 
"If she managed to create something effective, it could save countless lives."

narrator "Calyx looked between us, anxiety etched on his face."

Calyx "So, you’re saying Ysella might be our only hope?: 
"If her mother’s work is in her blood, could we save others?"

Dr. Curie "Yes," 
"But we need to act quickly. We have to monitor Ysella closely and run tests to fully understand the effects of whatever treatment her mother gave her." 
Time is of the essence."

narrator "I remembered that my mother had given me an extra vial, a small glimmer of hope amidst the chaos surrounding me." 
"But at that moment, my thoughts were consumed by Calyx; I didn’t want to save everyone else—I just wanted to save him." 
"The idea of being selfish, just this once, tugged at my conscience. I felt the weight of my mother’s legacy pressing down on me,"
"knowing that the vial could potentially help many, yet all I could think about was Calyx’ face, the way he smiled, and the warmth of his presence." 
"It was a battle between my desire to be selfless and the raw, undeniable pull of my heart, urging me to prioritize the one person who meant everything to me." 
"In that moment of desperation, I faced a profound dilemma," 
"to act on my love for Calyx or to honor my mother’s work by considering the greater good."


narrator "I stood at the edge of the dimly lit lab, my heart racing as I considered the gravity of our situation." 
"The air was thick with tension, and the distant sounds of chaos outside reminded me of the urgency that pressed down upon us."
"I turned to the scientist, my voice steady but laced with desperation." 

Ysella "Is it possible to replicate the cure using my blood samples?"

narrator "Dr. Curie looked up, her brow furrowed in thought."

Dr. Curie "It’s a complex process," 
"but if your blood contains the necessary antibodies, we might be able to create a viable treatment." 
"It could take days, though, and we’d need the right equipment."

narrator "I felt a flicker of hope, but it quickly dimmed as I thought of Calyx."

Ysella "And how long does it take for someone who’s been bitten to turn?" 

narrator "I pressed, urgency creeping into my tone. Dr. Curie hesitated, her expression grave."

Dr. Curie "It varies. Some can turn in mere moments, while others might take a day to a week." 
"But once the symptoms begin, it’s only a matter of time."

narrator "The weight of her words settled heavily on my shoulders." 
"The thought of Calyx, fighting against the encroaching darkness, filled me with dread."

narrator "As the shadows of the lab loomed larger, I felt the pressure of my decision bearing down on me." 
"Time was slipping away, and the undead were closing in. Should I take the risk and offer my blood for the greater good," 
"or should I hold on to hope for Calyx, even if it meant sacrificing the chance to save others?" 
"In that moment of desperation, I knew I had to decide, for the fate of those I loved hung in the balance."

narrator "Days passed in a haze of worry and despair, each one blending into the next as the world outside continued to crumble."
"Inside the isolation tent, Calyx lay on a makeshift cot, his skin pale and clammy," 
"the once vibrant spark in his eyes now dimmed by the relentless grip of the infection." 
"I could barely breathe as I watched him struggle, each labored breath a painful reminder of time slipping away."

narrator "The scientists had been working tirelessly, pouring over notes and samples, but every passing hour felt like a lifetime." 
"I often found myself at Calyx’s side, holding his hand, whispering words of encouragement that felt increasingly hollow." 
"I had already given my blood for testing, but the hope that had flickered in the beginning was fading, just like Calyx’ strength."

narrator "Then, one fateful afternoon, the door to our isolation den swung open with a loud bang." 
"Dr. Curie stormed in, her face flushed with a mix of excitement and urgency." 

Dr. Curie "I have news!" 

narrator "My heart raced as I looked up, clinging to a thread of hope."

Dr. Curie "There is indeed a cure,"
"It’s in your blood, Ysella." 
"Your unique antibodies can help us create a treatment." 
"But we need more samples—much more. We also need the vial that your mom left you." 
"I know there is one. I saw you holding it last night."

narrator "With that, I ushered Dr. Curie outside the tent to talk."

narrator "As I remembered what Dr. Curie said, my heart sank. The revelation was both exhilarating and terrifying."

Ysella "You mean… I will be able to  save him?" 

narrator "I asked, my voice barely above a whisper." 
"Everything else did not register to me, all that mattered was the thought of saving Calyx, the world, myself."

Dr. Curie "Yes." 
"But we need to act quickly." 
"The more blood we can collect, the better our chances of replicating the cure." 
"However, it will be a strain on you."

narrator "The thought of losing Calyx was unbearable, yet the idea of giving more of myself felt daunting." 

Ysella "What if something happens to me?"

Dr. Curie "We don’t have time to waste." 
"If we don’t act now, we might lose him entirely." 
"This could be the breakthrough we’ve been waiting for."

narrator "I felt a surge of conflicting emotions. The weight of my decision pressed heavily on my shoulders." 
"I could sacrifice my own well-being for the chance to save Calyx," 
"to save others, or I could hold back, fearing the unknown consequences."

Ysella

narrator "Dr. Curie looked at me with a mix of concern and urgency."

Dr. Curie "Ysella, time is not on our side. Every minute counts. If you’re going to use the serum, we need to act fast."

Ysella "I understand," 

narrator "Dr. Curie sighed, running a hand through her hair." 

Dr. Curie "I can’t guarantee anything, but the serum is our best chance."

Ysella "I know. I just… I need to talk to him first. I need to see him."

Dr. Curie "Very well," 
"You have a few moments. But make it quick. We don’t have much time."

narrator "Taking a deep breath, I turned and headed back inside the isolation tent." 
"The chaos of the evacuation camp swirled around me, but all I could focus on was Calyx—his face pale," 
"the bite mark on his arm darkening with each passing moment. I had to know what he wanted before I made my choice."
 "I spotted him in the corner of the isolation tent, waving weakly as I approached."

Calyx "Calyx!" 

narrator "He forced a smile, but it didn’t reach his eyes." 

Calyx "Hey, Ysella. I’m still here, but… I don’t think I’m going to make it anymore."

Ysella "No! You can’t say that!" 
"We’ll find a way to fix this!" 

narrator "Calyx shook his head slowly, the weight of reality settling heavily between us." 

Calyx "You don’t understand. The infection is spreading too fast. I can feel it. It’s only a matter of time."

narrator "My heart sank, panic clawing at my throat. 

Ysella "We can get you treated! There has to be something we can do!"

narrator "He looked at me, his expression softening, yet resolute." 

Calyx "Ysella, listen to me. You have to save yourself." 
"You can’t waste the serum on me. There are others who need it more." 
"I’ve seen the way they look at you. You’re their hope."

narrator "Tears streamed down my face as I clutched the vial tighter." 

Ysella "But what if it could save you? What if we could still fight this together?"

narrator "Calyx’ eyes glistened with unshed tears." 

Calyx "It’s not just about me anymore. You have to be strong." 
"If you care about me, you’ll do what’s right. You can’t let my fate hold you back."

narrator "The chaos outside grew louder, the sounds of panic echoing through the tent." 
"I felt my resolve wavering, torn between my love for him and the harsh reality we faced."

Ysella "I can’t just leave you here!" 
"You’re my best friend, my motivation, my inspiration to keep going! You mean everything to me!"

narrator "He reached for my hand, his grip weak but steady."

Calyx "And you mean everything to me too."
